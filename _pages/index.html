  <h1>Alice and Bob’s Debate: Art vs. Data</h1>
  <p>Alice and Bob are a couple of cinema directors in the region of California, in Hollywood. They have won every kind of award across the globe, by the power of them taking the ADA course and their movie direction passion! However, they still have one challenge, and it is not a small one: setting up a movie that will win an Oscar.</p>
  <p>Bob thinks that they mastered the art of movie direction and that they should not rely on any data whatsoever, while Alice wants a more thorough analysis, stating that, nowadays, we could not skip data as it is one of the revolutions of our world, to have a further idea of how to get an Oscar.</p>

  <!-- Dialog as Text Bubbles -->
  <div class="chat-container">
      <div class="bubble alice">
          <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "Bob, we’ve been phenomenal so far, but the Oscars? That’s a different beast. We need to strategize, and data analysis is the way forward."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bubble bob">
          <p><strong>Bob:</strong> "Alice, come on. We’re directors, not statisticians. We’ve mastered this craft with instinct, storytelling, and vision. Why complicate it with numbers?"</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bubble alice">
          <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "Because numbers don’t lie, Bob. They tell us what resonates with the audience, what themes are trending, and what the Academy historically loves. Think about it. Every Oscar winner has a certain... formula."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bubble bob">
          <p><strong>Bob:</strong> "A formula? Really? You think we can boil down art to some algorithm? Art is passion, emotion, and risks, Alice. You can’t program that."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bubble alice">
          <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "No, but you can guide it. Look, take last year's Best Picture. The themes of Oppenheimer? Ethical and political struggles. The tone? Bittersweet but uplifting. The cast? Accurate. That wasn’t a coincidence, Bob."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bubble bob">
          <p><strong>Bob:</strong> "So what, you want me to pitch some cookie-cutter, Academy-friendly plot? That’s not us. That’s not me. We’re artists, not trend-chasers."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bubble alice">
          <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "Not trend-chasers, but trend-aware. You have to adapt. The industry is evolving, and data is part of the revolution. It’s not about copying; it’s about understanding the playing field. Then we innovate within it."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bubble bob">
          <p><strong>Bob:</strong> "Alright, Madame Analyst, what would this data-driven Oscar bait look like? Enlighten me."</p>

<section class="site-section" id="Introduction">
    <h1>The Problematic: What Makes an Oscar-Winning Movie or Actor?</h1>
    
    <p>
        Winning an Academy Award is the pinnacle of cinematic achievement, but what sets Oscar-winning movies and actors apart from the rest? 
        Is it the genre, the budget, the cast dynamics, or something more intangible? On the other hand, what defines a performance worthy of an Oscar? 
        Are there trends in the roles, collaborations, or demographics of winning actors?
    </p>

    <div class="chat-container">
        <div class="bubble alice">
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "Bob, it’s not just about the movies. The actors play a crucial role too. A story can shine or fall apart depending on the performance."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bubble bob">
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> "Sure, Alice, but are you really going to tell me there’s a pattern to Oscar-worthy performances? Isn’t acting about pure talent?"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Our Question</h2>
    <p>
        What are the key factors that define Oscar-winning movies and actors? 
        For movies, we explore patterns in genres, budgets, storytelling, and audience appeal. 
        For actors, we investigate trends in roles, demographics, and collaborations. 
        Can we uncover the shared traits of those who stand out on Hollywood’s biggest stage?
    </p>

    <div class="chat-container">
        <div class="bubble bob">
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> "You know, Alice, I think you just want to crunch numbers because it’s easier than figuring out what makes a great actor tick."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bubble alice">
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "It’s not about reducing art to numbers, Bob. It’s about understanding the patterns behind success, so we can innovate with purpose."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
        For filmmakers, this analysis offers a roadmap to craft stories that resonate with audiences and critics alike. 
        For actors, it highlights the roles and characteristics that often capture the Academy’s attention. 
        For fans, it reveals the trends that define our cultural milestones. 
        And for the industry, it bridges creativity and strategy in an era where data shapes decisions as much as inspiration.

        <h1>Movie Dataset: A Fusion of Insights</h1>
        
        <p>
            The foundation of our analysis is a dataset that blends the best of historical and modern data. 
            This dataset combines two complementary sources:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CMU Movie Dataset:</strong> A detailed and structured dataset offering historical information about movies, including genres, directors, box office data, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Wikipedia Scraping:</strong> Fresh data scraped from Wikipedia, covering movies released between 2015 and 2024. This ensures our analysis reflects the most recent trends in cinema.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            By merging these datasets, we created a unified resource that provides a comprehensive view of Oscar-worthy films, combining historical context with contemporary insights.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Key Features of the Dataset</h2>
        <p>The dataset includes several important variables that form the basis of our analysis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Title and Release Date:</strong> Captures the movie name and release year, enabling chronological analysis of trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Genres:</strong> Categories such as drama, comedy, action, and biopics, helping us identify which genres dominate the awards.</li>
            <li><strong>Box Office Revenue:</strong> Financial performance metrics to explore whether profitability correlates with critical acclaim.</li>
            <li><strong>Awards:</strong> Data on Oscar nominations and wins, including the number of Oscars received and categories awarded.</li>
            <li><strong>Runtime:</strong> The length of each movie, providing insights into whether longer films are more likely to win awards.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages and Countries:</strong> Geographic and linguistic data to analyze trends in international and domestic cinema.</li>
            <li><strong>Capital Cost:</strong> Production costs, highlighting the impact of budget size on success.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <div class="chat-container">
            <div class="bubble bob">
                <p><strong>Bob:</strong> "So, Alice, you’re telling me this dataset is like the perfect movie—it has everything: history, modernity, and a touch of intrigue."</p>

        <h2>Initial Observations</h2>
        <p>
            Before diving deep, we noticed some interesting trends while exploring the dataset:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genres:</strong> Drama is a perennial favorite for the Oscars, but socially conscious films and biopics have gained prominence in recent years.</li>
            <li><strong>Box Office:</strong> While higher budgets and revenues often align with awards, there are notable exceptions where smaller productions shine.</li>
            <li><strong>Runtime:</strong> Movies with runtimes exceeding two hours tend to dominate critical acclaim.</li>
            <li><strong>International Recognition:</strong> The past decade has seen an increase in recognition for non-English films, marking a shift in Academy preferences.</li>

        What sets Oscar-winning movies apart? Is it their genre, runtime, or perhaps their thematic depth? 
        Using our data, we analyze key factors that differentiate award-winning films from the rest. 
        From runtime and revenue to global trends, we uncover patterns that define success in cinema.

            <p>
                Oscar winners predominantly hail from Hollywood, yet contributions from other regions are growing. 
                This highlights a trend toward greater diversity in Academy recognition, but the dominance of the western world remains strong.

                The majority of Oscar-winning films have a runtime of 120–150 minutes. Shorter films (less than 90 minutes) are rare winners, 
                suggesting the Academy prefers movies with more time to develop their narrative complexity.

    <h2>3. Title and Theme Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Oscar-winning movies often showcase themes of love, war, and personal struggles. But what about the movies that didn’t win?

                In contrast, non-winning movies often focus on lighter or niche themes, with titles emphasizing adventure, humor, or less traditional narratives.

    <h1>Actor Analysis: The Faces of Oscar Success</h1>
    
    <p>
        Actors are the beating heart of any film, breathing life into stories and capturing emotions that resonate deeply with audiences and critics alike. 
        In this section, we analyze the trends and factors that distinguish Oscar-winning actors from the rest, exploring their demographics, roles, and 
        industry impact.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Diversity: A Global Perspective</h2>
    <p>
        The majority of Oscar-winning actors hail from North America, particularly the United States, and Europe, with the United Kingdom leading the way. 
        Despite the rich cinematic traditions of Asia and Africa, actors from these regions remain underrepresented in the Oscars. However, globalization 
        and the Academy’s recent push for inclusivity suggest a growing opportunity for diverse talents to gain recognition. Notable breakthroughs, like 
        performances in culturally significant roles, often receive critical acclaim and could signify a shifting trend toward greater diversity in the 
        industry.

    <h2>2. Gender Representation</h2>
    <p>
        Male actors have historically dominated the Oscars, particularly in the Best Actor and Supporting Actor categories. However, female actors have 
        been gaining ground, with the Academy increasingly recognizing performances that challenge societal norms or depict powerful narratives. Films 
        like <em>The Favourite</em> and <em>Nomadland</em> showcase how complex, multifaceted female characters resonate with both audiences and the 
        Academy.

            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "About time, Bob. Strong female leads aren’t just trendsetters—they’re timeless."</p>

    </div>

    <h2>3. Age Dynamics</h2>
    <p>
        The age distribution of Oscar-winning actors reveals distinct patterns. Male actors tend to win between the ages of 35 and 55, maintaining strong 
        representation even into their 60s. Female actors, however, typically win between 25 and 40, with representation dropping sharply after the age 
        of 40. This disparity reflects broader trends in the industry, where opportunities for actresses tend to diminish with age, even as their male 
        counterparts continue to thrive in leading roles.

            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "The age gap is glaring, Bob. It’s tough for actresses to get roles past 40."</p>

        <div class="bubble bob">
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> "That’s true, Alice. Maybe it’s time to write roles that challenge those norms."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>4. Box Office and Actor Success</h2>
    <p>
        Movies featuring Oscar-winning actors generally exhibit more consistent box office performance compared to films without such actors. However, 
        high-revenue outliers are more common in movies without Oscar-winning actors, indicating that commercial success doesn’t always correlate with 
        critical acclaim. While Oscar-winning actors bring consistency, the presence of these actors alone is not a guaranteed formula for box office 
        dominance.

            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "Exactly, Bob. It’s about finding the right balance between artistic merit and commercial appeal."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Genre Representation</h2>
    <p>
        The genres associated with Oscar-winning actors reveal a dominance of drama, romance, and comedy. However, action and adventure genres have 
        also made notable contributions, often through technically excellent performances that push the boundaries of traditional acting. The success of 
        films like <em>Gladiator</em> and <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> underscores the Academy’s growing appreciation for dynamic roles in unconventional 
        genres.
