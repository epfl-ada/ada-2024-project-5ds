Movie name: Sunrise
Review: One of the most innovative pieces of cinema EVER. Absolutely love the emotion that’s conveyed in this; it’s genuine, it’s real, it’s beautiful, and it makes this one of the greatest silent films of all time. F. W. Murnau struck cinematic gold with Nosferatu (1922) and Faust (1926), but this is a completely different beast and is captivating in every way.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: A mix of German expressionism and realism, the influences from the era it was made created a beautiful film.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: A near perfect film. Proof that silent films can be both emotional and exciting. It is also a technical wonder for its time. The performances from Janet Gaynor and especially George O'Brien are flawless. So much can be said with almost no words. Remarkable. One of the greatest film experiences of all time.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: Honestly, you can say the first half of this is a masterpiece. It is filmed in such a different way and with more care and consideration than any movie from the era. There is a little lull after where it dips into some misplaced silent film slapstick, the ending sequence is a little weird story wise but beautifully filmed.

Review: One of the earliest silent film movies of its time.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: Sunrise might have been called Sunset, and the title would have seemed equally appropriate. Watching the movie today is like seeing an art form reaching its highest peak just at the point when that particular medium was about to die forever. The streets that see in the movie were actually a studio set costing $200,000. The film company recovered some of the costs by using the set in other films of the time. Some cost-cutting was made by using smaller sets in the background, and making them seem bigger with use of forced perspective, the optical illusion of making smaller objects appear as if they are further away. Murnau understood the craft of how to visually convey meaning to the audiences better than almost any director of his time. There is not a single moment in Sunrise where the audience feels confused about what is happening. His storytelling is crystal clear, and yet it is told with minimal intertitles. The use of a synchronised music score and sound effects also help to clarify what is happening in scenes. What Murnau showed best in Sunrise is how much more sophisticated late silent movies were than the early sound movies. The need to soundproof the cameras so that they could not be heard on the final movie led to an era of static camerawork. Here in Sunrise, we have nothing of the sort. The camera has a freedom that it would not have for several years. One notable feature is Murnau's use of long tracking shots, still something of a rarity in an age when visual movement was limited by the need to crank up the camera. This was made easier by the fact that even many of the outdoors scenes in Sunrise were filmed in a studio. When The Man and The Woman from the City meet in a marsh, it is merely a set, allowing Murnau to put the camera on an overhead rail to achieve the long tracking shot required to make the scene so effective. Murnau's camera crew also had access to a camera with an electric motor. On several occasions, images are superimposed onto one another. We see a train and a boat in a split screen effect, perhaps reflecting the personality of the main character in the movie. Images of the marsh fill the bottom of the screen while images of the city fill the top of it, as if to show The Man's thoughts. In another scene, The Man is lying on the bed while above him we see an image of the water on the lake where he is planning to drown The Wife. This visual effect was achieved by masking part of the screen, and then exposing the rest of it. Murnau could then arrange for the second image to be exposed in the areas where the first image was masked, and masked in the places where the first image was exposed. The action revolves around three people. None of them is named. There is The Man (George O'Brien), The Wife (Janet Gaynor) and The Woman from the City (Margaret Livingston). The absence of names has led some people to view the work as allegorical. If the story is an allegory, we may ask who are the two humans in the film's title, especially since there are three central characters. Could it be the two women in The Man's life, who may represent good and evil? I do not see them as allegorical representations myself. They seem to me to indicate two possible paths that The Man can follow. One is domesticated and a little dull, but safe and perhaps more fulfilling in the end. The other is thrilling, but it will destroy him. Which choice will he make? Perhaps the two humans are both The Man – his lighter and darker sides. He is under the influence of temptation that may bring calamity on himself and others, but he also has a kinder and more compassionate side that might redeem him. A more likely explanation is the least interesting one. The two humans are The Man and his Wife. This seems to be hinted at in an early intertitle in the film. The married couple are at the heart of the movie. The action follows their marital problems in the first part, a cessation of those problems in the second part, and an unexpected separation in the last part. By contrast The Woman from the City is only dominant in the first part. She is almost totally absent from the middle section of the film, and never regains her importance in the final part. What the first two parts of Sunrise have established is that tragedy need not be inevitable. In many film noirs, there is a fatalistic sense that the characters are trapped by circumstances and by their own moral weakness. They are doomed from the start. In Sunrise, there is still the sense that people have a choice, and the chance to change their destiny at any point. Whether Sunrise ends happily or unhappily, the outcome was not pre-ordained, and could gone differently. A happy or an unhappy ending would have been equally correct.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: This silent film teaches morality lessons with 3 characters in one day. Handsome farmer is being seduced by a city woman. Her evil plan against his wife just cannot be done. Instead, he falls in love with his wife again. There is more, but I won't tell.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: This is truly a cinematic masterpiece that should never be lost to time. It was one of the 2 films that won the most awards in the very 1st Academy Awards. Watching the film you get lost in the love between the Man and the Wife and how it was almost destroyed before they built it back. It's poetic and it's timeless. The first intertitle says 'This song of the Man and his Wife is of no place and every place: you might hear it anywhere at anytime'. It's a tale that's both old as time, yet still can ring true to this day. A truly beautiful piece of artwork that I hope everyone gets the chance to see.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: Usual over-acting style of silent film. I felt the middle part was unnecessarily long. I don't think it needed the comedic elements. However, there were some wonderfully innovative cinematic elements, like the drowning subtitles and the walking between cars. 7/10.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: F.W. Murnau's Sunrise is certainly a film from a different era. Case in point: after a failed attempt to murder her, a woman forgives her husband within a matter of minutes after he offers a sincere apology and takes her out for a swingin' night on the town. After almost a hundred years, it is understandably dated in terms of both style and content. Despite its shortcomings, what makes it watchable are the effectively restrained performances, some interesting images and special effects, and some truly remarkable lighting. While hailing Sunrise as one of the all-time greats, as many do, is probably a bit of an overstatement, it is still interesting viewing even a century after the fact, a pretty impressive accomplishment.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: The first half is a little boring but the second half really pucks up and has some interesting plot twists for the time.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is an enduring and endearing story. Janet Gaynor's performance is so pure that you don't want anything bad to happen to her, and you can almost see the heavy weight that George O'Brien's character is carrying. This silent film is also a technical marvel, with many visual effects that were far ahead of their time. Take the time to watch Sunrise and remind yourself of what's really important in life.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: Heralded as one, if not the greatest silent film ever made, Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans won the very first Academy Award for Best Unique and Artistic Picture during the first ceremony in 1929. It is another striking example of German expressionism and also is one of the very first films with a synchronized musical score and sound effects soundtrack.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: A masterpiece but with a meager story that remains picturesque soporific for a long evening. This is widely considered by critics and historians to be one of the greatest films ever made. The groundbreaking cinematogrophy features tracking shots. Tiles appear sparingly with long sequences of pure action and the bulk told in FW Murnau's style. Forced perspective is striking, particularly in a shot of the City with normal people in the foreground and smaller in the background. Very likely the greatest film of the silent era.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: One of the most beautiful love story ever made for the screen, but don't expect anything corny here. It has a thriller touch, and is very catchy and surprising. The cinematography is incredible for its time, very very beautiful. A masterpiece.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: Murnau's creative vision gives us a dream world of romance. German auteur F. W. Murnau's direction is breathtaking and dreamy for his silent romantic drama Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927), which went on to win The Oscar Award for Best Unique and Artistic Picture at the very first Academy Awards. Murnau brings his iconic Gothic and German Expressionist cinema to Hollywood with dazzling results. I adore Murnau's heavy fog in the marshes to the ravaging waters and bustling city streets and gusts of windstorms. The camera will fly by people enjoying a carnival to characters walking past cars whirring by in the cityscape. Sunrise captures dim nights and lively daylight fun alike. Cinematographers Charles Rosher and Karl Struss bring black and white to vivid life. I love their long panning shot creeping through a marsh as bushes part to reveal Margaret Livingston's vamp City Girl by the pale moonlight. Her style of jet black modern hair with a flowing dark flapper dress could be considered Goth in appearance now. Livingston is perfectly sly and eager to seduce George O'Brien's brooding man Anses. He is creepy and unsettling, then brimming with love as he begs for forgiveness, then finally full of despair and joy at the touching ending. I have to mention that Sunrise stars a young, cute, petite, and endearing Janet Gaynor as Indre, the sweet wife to George O'Brien's Anses. Gaynor is stunningly beautiful and so evocative of all the pain men bring their wives. Her expressive, gentle face reveals an inner sorrow very naturally for this era of more impressionistic and bombastic acting like O'Brien. No wonder audiences were so charmed by Janet Gaynor. She's not just breathtaking, but heartfelt with real tears and a smile that lights up the screen better than Sunlight. Murnau shows us love and loveless feelings with equal grandeur in his splendid silent feature. Massive sets, tons of extras, lights all over, and live animals perform like a concerned pet dog to a wine drunk piglet. Sunrise has it all. There's a dance sequence spliced in between comedy gags of an unrelated man pulling up a lady's dress straps repeatedly. Sunrise is romance drama, suspense horror, slapstick comedy, dance musical, survival thriller, and atmosphere expressionism at its finest. I found myself amazing at how innovative every scene feels with raw emotions, complex relationships, and a feminine perspective. Producer William Fox invited F. W. Murnau to Hollywood with unlimited creative control and a big budget, so Murnau pulls off every visual trick imaginable. Editor Harold D. Schuster fades faces embracing into a burning passionate sunrise, a mistress' hands clutching the man she's having an affair with will fade onto the screen while her face appears in the distance, a band will burst into song on one half of the screen while people dance on the other. Sunrise doesn't feel its quick 94 minute runtime. Many of Schuster's cuts look like the experimental style more popular in the early 1970's, not 1927. Amazingly ahead of time. Writer Hermann Sudermann's story starts out about a married man contemplating drowning his beloved and doting wife to leave for the city with his mistress. Sunrise is about rekindling lost love due to ordinary conflicts like cheating into the extraordinary circumstance of a man deciding to actually kill his wife to escape to a new love. Sunrise progresses naturally as Murnau delivers strong romantic flirting and dramatic encounters with real energy. Charles Dudley's make-up work is very classic with Gothic dark looks for everyone, except for Janet Gaynor's natural beautiful look. All the classical music in Sunrise boasts thudding foreboding and serene romance from composers Hugo Riesenfeld, Willy Schmidt-Gentner, Erno Rapee, R. H. Bassett, as well as Carli Elinor. In short, Sunrise is bursting with life and romance. I highly recommend F. W. Murnau's Sunrise for any romantic at heart who desires to see the best silent cinema has to offer.

Review: Fun to watch and great to hear sound-on-film Fox Movietone effects. Funny that Janet Gaynor appears to be wearing the same wig worn by the mother in TV film "Sybil."

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: There's not much to the story, but then again, silent film era dramas never seem to have sophisticated story lines. Undeniably, however, Murnau's direction is flawless and the film's technical aspects were way ahead of their time.

Movie name: Sunrise
Review: Beautiful shot at 3 minutes from the boat to the bay area filled with pine trees and coastal homes. Wow, very ambitious cinematography the way it sweeps across as if an angel is flying around with the camera. Damn the is sad as shit! Seems like the guy and his wife need to rekindle that flame. Jesus this bitch from the City is vindictive, wanting to drown the guys wife. Wtf?! I'm surprised by how atmospheric this movie is. I wasn't expecting that. So sad to see that his wife still cares for him and loves him even though she knows what he's doing with the other girl. She seems so sweet, so innocent, so fragile. I could never get rid of her or kill her or even cheat on her. Oh my god! That dog was such a good boy. Trying to stop her from getting on the boat and then jumping in the water so they would have to go back to shore. Them ending up in that church was a realization to the husband but it was almost like them getting married again. Very beautiful how they presented it. And then that emotional kiss they have in front of all the traffic and everyone getting annoyed that they're blocking the road. I'm glad they were able to rekindle their love for one another. I just hope this City bitch doesn't come and ruin everything. I don't know what they gave that little piggy, but he was drunk on something or maybe like a tranquilizer. That little piggy escaping into the city I think is sort of a reflection of the couple escaping into the city. I guess the storm while they were in the boat was kind of like a test to kind of remind him to not take for granted the wonderful wife he has. It's funny, the City girl pretty much saved his wife's life. She was the one that told him to put the bulrushes on the boat so that he could float back to safety and that's what ended up saving the wife's life. That sunrise at the very end is almost like them being reborn, their marriage and their love towards one another. I guess this movie's really about the sanctimony of marriage and how important loyalty is. Also how we can't let temptation get the better of us. This movie shows us and proves to us that a dying love can be rekindled by the right circumstances and experiences. It's important to get away from the everyday drudgery that is life and have some fun. Quite wonderful how they present the story in a very charming way. The chemistry between the two actors was off the charts. They complimented each other perfectly. She was so sweet and charming and him very strong and protective of her. You can see it in the choreographed dance they do, they're in sync. On another note, this movie had some pretty funny moments like the guy that kept pulling up the woman's shoulder strap on her dress. I thought it was a wonderful silent movie with a beautiful message. I'd definitely watch it again.

Movie name: White Shadows in the South Seas
Review: Some beautiful black and white film footage of the South Seas and its native inhabitants are seen in this film by Woody Van Dyke who managed to find time enough to put a coherent plot into the film. Monte Blue is a doctor with a social conscience sick of how the white traders are exploiting the south sea natives has gone native himself and is living not much better than them. He falls in love with Raquel Torres daughter of the high chief who is promised to their island Deity. The cinematography won an Oscar.

Movie name: White Shadows in the South Seas
Review: While a well photographed anti-imperialist silent film collaboration between Robert J. Flaherty & W.S. Van Dyke starring Monte Blue sounds like something I can dig into, I found it far to trite and melodramatic for my taste.

Movie name: White Shadows in the South Seas
Review: Past the didactic beginning, the movie melds locations, documentary footage of the native islanders and their routines, and the shifting mood of the protagonist. It's a simple story, but it's well-told and follows through on its message all the way to the ending.

Movie name: White Shadows in the South Seas
Review: Monte Blue plays a doctor to live on a Polynesian island. He is appalled at how the native pearl divers are used and exploited by a ruthless entrepeneur. They clash. Of course there is romance involved as well. Fascinating silent film, beautifully photographed and has a pleasant score.

Movie name: White Shadows in the South Seas
Review: Silent film from 1928 that won the second Oscar for Best Cinematography. It's not too bad, there is some nice photography throughout, and the story isn't too bad, it's about a group of white men that come to a tropical island and make the natives dive for pearls, which results in many of the natives getting injured and dying. One of the white men is against the use of the natives, so he's sent to die, but he manages to land on an island of new natives and they treat him as a god. Good moments and compared to some of the silent films from that time this one doesn't drag too much, or rather, it tends to keep your interest. But overall, it's just pretty good. Oh, and though my copy that I watched didn't have it, this is supposed to be the first movie that Leo, the MGM lion, roars.in.

Movie name: White Shadows in the South Seas
Review: this is an interesting film only for the visuals. there is some great early underwater shots and some great uses of filters. on the other hand, this is stuff that griffith was doing years earlier. and flaherty/murnau did similar stuff in tabu, whcih wasnt that great either

Review: Not only is the movie full of long sequences of with no story whatsoever, but it's one of the worst examples of reverse racism I've ever seen.

Movie name: With Byrd at the South Pole
Review: This was so interesting. There were no dull moments in this documentary. I was very engrossed in suave Byrd and his men in the Antarctic. I loved the penguins, seals, and huskies. It is incredible that they could live in those conditions and blizzards. The story of Spy was heart-wrenching. I could feel how scared I would be to live there, even temporarily! It was patriotically American, but there was a nod to nations that came before them. I was amazed they built the plane on site! I wonder how much of this (if any) was re-enacted. It looks very authentic. The score was great and suited the documentary well. The pictures of the Ross Barrier were terrific. Did it deserve an Oscar Nom-Nom? Yes and no. There was no documentary field then, but this would have won with bells on if there were. As for cinematography, I am amazed the camera worked in those conditions and impressed the camera operators stayed the course. However, there weren't any special camera effects - it was point-and-shoot - but it was well done.

Movie name: With Byrd at the South Pole
Review: When placed in context of time and place, this film is quite an achievement. The conditions alone merit the cinematography Oscar.

Movie name: With Byrd at the South Pole
Review: This is not just a documentory, it is filmed history. Amazing cinematography and very fascinating and engrossing. An incredible film that had me in awe throughout.

Review: Decent documentary about Byrd's flight over the South Pole.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: After watching Trader Horn recently, Tabu was a much better version of showing other cultures. The plot was exciting but a little slow. The ending was beautifully captured and poignant. The actors were good, and I felt like I was watching real life. Being silent helped in this case. My biggest bugbear of the movie was that the music was not from the culture portrayed. Very disappointing! The places looked lovely, and I liked the little piggy.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: Alright for the time it came out but sadly lost most of it's value over time. I do like that it takes place in a time in place most movies don't go to but it is very boring at times and has a rather abrupt ending.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: The story is entertaining enough. What I really enjoyed, however, was its depiction of Tahitian culture. I don't know how accurate it is, but I found it fascinating.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: F.W. Murnau left this film as his final effort, dying shortly after. It is a solidly filmed presentation of the south seas. The plot involves a clash between island civilization and that of modern western society. A tale of two lovers who have been put upon by superstition and quaint religious rule. The problem is that there is no place for them to find peace.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: Starting in familiar territory for early film with a simplistic romance of lovers forced apart by convention, Tabu gradually feeds in more complex themes, touching on colonization from the perspective of native inhabitants, traditionalism vs. progress, and the power of perception (the haunting nature of 'Tabu' whether enforced by tangible consequences or when its effects are only imagined). Perhaps most stunning for the period is the film's tragic ending, with little hint of even bittersweet tones, instead opting for complete failure on the part of the protagonists to succeed against the forces that would drive them apart. Beautifully shot on-location, the film may not have taken advantage of the sound technology that was by this point far more than a novelty, but it remains a stunning depiction of the Polynesian setting. It's not the greatest Murnau, but establishing any film as clearly superior among the director's limited and high-quality output (which includes Nosferatu and Sunrise) is quite difficult. (3.5/5)

Movie name: Tabu
Review: Murnau's last masterpiece. A romance of exploitation, tradition, and the defiance of such.

Review: 1001 movies to see before you die. Kind of a islander piece where they come into conflict with civilization in a rough way. Rather tragic ending.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: Tabu is glorious, full of sparkling, radiant images that feel like heaven on earth, even in its beautifully heart-breaking conclusion.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: "Tabu" has a very simple storyline but manages to achieve classic status for being innovative, beautifully made and quite moving too. The acting by the non-professional locals is very convincing and moves the story forward, while the appearances of Hitu and the scenes with the shark (underwater footage ftw) are surprisingly suspenseful. Particularly well-written it is not, yet the resonant alternation between beautiful and tragic running through the entire film elevates it to compelling viewing.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: A frustratingly simple documentary/narrative film about those who inhabited the south seas & their fear of native woman Tabu. Filmed authentically on location it simply lacked impact & engagement & considering the depth his other films had I was surprised this was so highly praised. Will appeal to people connected to the South Seas & those who love that locale but I found myself struggling to keep in engaged at all:

Movie name: Tabu
Review: Tabu: A Story of the South Seas (1931) - 7,5 Last work from Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Just like Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans, this is a love archetype promoting a universal message. The story unravels within the seed of a tribal community inhabiting Bora Bora, a remote island in French Polinesia. Matahi and Reri ride against forces of higher power within the tribe to preserve their love bond. The resistance is stretched to the limits of what is humanly possible hereby sentencing their tale to a tragic fate. This movie is so engaging that it's easy forget that one is seeing a docufiction. As is hallmark of this genre, it's not possible to separate reality from fiction in what is partly a real documentation of the people of Bora Bora and their culture. All the characters are the real tribal natives and chinese living in the region. By virtue of which Tabu invokes a different kind of allure from Sunrise's. The idyllic landscape, the tribal rituals and the close contact with nature contrast with the modern world of Sunrise, and craft a rawer and a potentially more nostalgic experience. But ultimately, Tabu doesn't have the impact of a timeless masterpiece like Sunrise. That monumental dreamlike enchantment of Sunrise is missing from Tabu. This is a slightly more earthen and dry experience. In any case, Tabu has great poetic beauty and emotional power. The top-notch camera work and cinematography earned Floyd Crosby an Academy Award for Best Cinematography, while the archetypal performance as Reri launched Anne Chevalier's acting career for the following years. This beautiful work of silent cinema was homaged by Miguel Gomes in 2012 with his homonymous film which I highly enjoyed. Recommended!

Movie name: Tabu
Review: After the Great Depression, audiences needed a happy, upbeat tale of love on the south seas. Aw yeah.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: One of the first films ever to be shot on location, in the gorgeous South Pacific, Tabu is a beautiful and tragic story that captures Polynesian life that at the time of its production was largely unknown to the western world. F.W. Murnau shows what a true film gem he was and it makes it all the more unfortunate that this was his last work, he died in a car crash that very prematurely ended his outstanding career.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: Die Tage durfte ich einem wunderbaren Ereignis beiwohnen: Das alljährliche Summer-Open-Air-Kino des Filmarchivs Austria bot ein Screening von F.W. Murnaus letztem Film Tabu an. Ein Stummfilm, über 80 Jahre alt, und nicht wirklich einer seiner spektakulärsten oder bekanntesten Filme, war die Vorstellung dennoch gut besucht (ein Understatement: es war proppenvoll). Mein Vertrauen in die Menschheit ist wieder ein Stück gestiegen. Live dabei, war ein Duo von indischen (?) oder zumindest asiatisch inspirierten Musikern, die weniger Musikbegleitung als Soundeffekte boten. Unterlegt von stetem Meeresrauschen schufen die beiden eine eigenwillige Klangatmosphäre, die meinen Eindruck des Films wohl entscheidend prägte. Tabu handelt von einem Liebespaar von Inselbewohnern in der Südsee, dass durch die Ernennung des Mädchens zu einer Art göttlichen Jungfrau auseinandergerissen wird. Das Mädchen ist nämlich von nun an Tabu". Die beiden jungen Liebenden pfeifen jedoch auf diese Regeln und setzen sich per Boot auf eine andere Insel ab. Ihre Verfolger sind ihnen jedoch dicht auf den Fersen und so entbrennt eine Mischung aus Abenteuergeschichte und Romanze mit unzähligen kleinen Twists und Subplots. Rein erzählerisch ist Murnau hier auf ausgetestetem Hollywoodniveau daheim, die Geschichte ist kitschig, etwas rassistisch und anti-feministisch, aber was soll's, das geniale an Murnau ist in diesem Fall nicht WAS für eine Geschichte er erzählt, sondern WIE er sie erzählt. Mit beeindruckender Kamera (inklusive Unterwasseraufnahmen und expressionistischen Schattenspielen), und ohne Zwischentitel (in dieser Hinsicht schummelt er ein paar Mal mit Hilfe von Briefen) überlässt er es großteils den Bildern selbst seine Geschichte voranzutreiben. Diese Fähigkeit goutiere ich sehr. Erstens, empfinde ich den übermäßigen Einsatz von Zwischentiteln in Stummfilmen ohnehin als störend (überhaupt wenn sie bloß Dialog beschreiben, was in Tabu Gott sei Dank nie vorkommt) und zweitens ist das Erzählen mittels Bildern, und Bildern allein, im heutigen Kino eine Seltenheit geworden (Tarkovsky ist ja leider auch schon seit einiger Zeit tot). Auch beeindruckend fand ich die Erzählgeschwindigkeit (wohl bedingt durch die Absenz von Zwischentiteln), die sich durchaus mit modernen Filmen messen kann, und den Film leicht verträglich machte. Zu Analysieren (psychologisch und interpretatorisch) gibt es in Tabu wohl weniger als in vergleichbaren hochgeschätzten Filmen des Regisseurs, handwerklich ist dieser letzte Film Murnaus Spitzenklasse. Er zeugt von der hohen Qualität, die die Stummfilmkunst Ende der 20er/Anfang der 30er erreicht hatte, und die im Tonfilm erst nach einigen Jahren wieder zu sehen war. Darüberhinaus, ist Tabu auch ein exzellentes Beispiel für die Merkmale und Besonderheiten des Stummfilms, die mit dem Ton verloren gingen. Murnau hat nie einen Tonfilm gemacht, und obwohl es sicherlich interessant gewesen wäre, einen solchen vom Meister zu sehen, liegen seine Qualitäten eindeutig im visuellen Gestalten - Murnau ist ein Bildermacher, ein Expressionist und deshalb auch ohne Ton sehr erfolgreich.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: Murnau certainly had an eye for images, here found on Bora Bora and Tahiti, with amazing use of light and framing. Inspired by Flaherty, he uses an all native cast to tell a fabled story of paradise and paradise lost. Surprisingly for 1931 this is relatively noncondescending to the culture in focus (although certainly some aspects are dated). The fable is a simple story and the roles taken also require simplicity in outlook and action. In these symbolic roles, the boy and girl and the sinister leader, Hitu, are all excellent -- only the shark seems fake. Murnau keeps the pace moving along and the viewer is sure to be wowed.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: Another wonderful silent from Murnau. His visual sensibility is unmatched, the camera so expressive. This is no more true than in the final shot of Matahi in the ocean. Further, the use of light (esp. moonlight) and shadow, as well as the sequences involving dance and ritual, bring a great deal of feeling and weight to the proceedings. Finally, the visual contrast between the film's two halves underlines the film's moral sensibility--sunny and natural in the former, dark and seedy in the latter.

Movie name: Tabu
Review: A beautiful looking and sounding (although it's 'silent') film, Murnau's last.

Movie name: Shanghai Express
Review: I liked the movie's plot, although it could have been a touch faster. I liked the moral of the story, and while the end was predictable, it was well done. I wish they made Chang a bit more menacing, though. What I didn't like about this movie was the acting! Clive Brooks, who I usually really like, was terrible! And Marlene Dietrich wasn't much better. Both were so stilted and corny, and there was no chemistry between them. Maybe I should blame the director for this, as usually they are really good, but wow! It spoiled the movie for me! The only acting I did enjoy was Lawrence Grant. What makes this movie sing is the cinematography and design. The lighting was so well done - so classy and sublime. The outfits were iconic, making Marlene look stunning. 7.2/10.

Movie name: Shanghai Express
Review: Good for the time I guess. However, nothing exceptional in cinematography (except Marlene Dietrich closeups), story or acting (just Marlene Dietrich being Marlene Dietrich). I have no idea why people think this movie is interesting, it really lacks any interesting plot developments, and the romance is just stupid...a woman who desperately wants a man to trust her love, but gives him no reason to? One thing I noticed was that no one in the movie drank, because the movie was made during prohibition. At that time in China, all the Brits would be downing gin! Yet another unrealistic element in an overall waste of time.

Movie name: Shanghai Express
Review: The movie is set in the turbulent times of the Chinese civil wars, and revolves around the mostly-European first class travelers on the Peking-to-Shanghai Express train. The leads are Marlene Dietrich as Shanghai Lily and Clive Brook as Captain Harvey, who are ex-lovers. Since their estrangement, Lily had become a "coaster" or "a woman who lives by her wits". Anna May Wong is another "fallen" woman, a Chinese one. Add a Chinese warlord traveling incognito, a missionary, a gambler, an opium dealer, and a boarding house keeper, and you have all the elements needed for an explosive screenplay. The movie does not disappoint, filled with intense emotional moments as well as dramatic and suspenseful sequences, the excellent ensemble cast delivering fine performances all around. I was particularly mesmerized by the production design and photography - the train station scenes as well the scenes on board with the incessant click-clack of the train all were done masterfully. I was happy to note that the movie was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar (losing to the "Grand Hotel") but did get the Oscar for Cinematography. This is one terrific popcorn movie - don't miss it!

Movie name: Shanghai Express
Review: This film is about a group of European and American first class travelers on a train who are held hostage by a warlord during the Chinese Civil War. It was dubbed Grand Hotel on wheels. Marelene Dietrich gives a great performance and the film is useful as a piece of history. The real events of the 1923 Lincheng incident were more dramatic. The film presents a curious bifurcation on race in that the respectable white characters are seen as both flawed and racist and the film is surprisingly feminist. It's memorable for its stylistic black and white chiaroscuro cinematography.

Review: Marlene Dietrich is SO gorgeous, her outfits SO amazing, and her acting SO engaging that I was entranced. The cinematography clearly deserved the Academy Award it got.

Movie name: Shanghai Express
Review: ...an eighty-two minute train ride across contemporary China rife with barely-comprehensible intrigue and a continuous barrage of ornately busy visuals. A passenger train complete with sliding glass doors and lavish interior is the dominant setting. China's then-colonialist division justifies the array of diverse accents and ethnicities in this warped, artificial version of the real thing. Like all of these films, Shanghai Express is a total Hollywood studio-based shoot. Though engaging in racial stereotypes and outright fictions about China, von Sternberg probably employed every actor, extra (and then some) of Chinese descent. Though the whole thing is culturally suspect by today's standards, it's interesting to think that back then, mounting a film like this one in this manner would seem downright progressive. The movie itself is a fair potboiler, but one doesn't board this train for the plot, nor for its destination. It's the journey and the scenery that are everything. Those, and of course the company of fellow travelers.

Movie name: Shanghai Express
Review: A somewhat pulpy, populist exotic romance that is kicked up to a higher standard by a performance from Dietrich that perfectly captures her screen persona as the independently-minded, sexually liberated woman in chic evening wear surrounded by cigarette smoke and constantly delivering her aloof dialogue with a chill. Four films into their collaboration, Sternberg was fully aware how to place and effectively light his star to maximize her presence in front of the camera. The narrative sets itself up as something of a Murder on the Oriental Express predecessor, introducing a series of colorful and distinctive characters trapped in a train, but with the exception that Shanghai Express doesn't really take the time to explore or capitalize on most of them. The entire Chinese Civil War setting is really just dressing for the romance between Lily and Harvey; Wong's Hui Fei murders the top commander of the Chinese rebel forces (Oland's Chang, criminally underexplored) in his own camp before the group just sort of leaves with virtually no resistance or consequences. Though the film establishes itself on atmosphere and slickness, it's not always a winner in that department, with such nuggets as "How in the name of Confucius can I kiss you with all these people around?" The film may not focus exclusively on Dietrich, but she is doubtlessly the reason that this film hasn't slipped into obscurity, singlehandedly salvaging much of Shanghai Express on persona alone (though Wong is great as well). (4/5)

Review: Atmospheric allure and shady dealings everywhere. Josef von Sternberg's romance drama Shanghai Express (1932) is a dark adventure into the heart of China with breathtaking cinematography from Lee Garmes. If the rumors are true that Austrian auteur Josef von Sternberg actually shot Shanghai Express himself, then he had a phenomenal eye for illuminated faces with eerie lighting, smoky atmosphere, and black silhouettes backlit for stunning scene after scene. Sternberg quickly cuts from conversation to gunshots, threats and escapes for a brisk 82 minute picture of magnificent craftsmanship. Shanghai Express is one of the greatest black and white films ever made and directed by master filmmaker Josef von Sternberg in his prime. Marlene Dietrich is the real draw here as the enticing and regal Shanghai Lily. She's believable as a high class escort making the rounds along the coast of Shanghai. Dietrich is playfully alluring with a strong sex appeal due to her effortless grace and charming confidence. The way she rejects men with a word or wave of her hand is amazing. Dietrich's films are feminist because she is in control and has her own agency. Marlene Dietrich is one of my favorite actresses and Shanghai Express features one of her most vulnerable and endearing performances. Her hand shaking with trembling emotions for her love as she quietly smokes her ever present cigarette in the darkness of her train compartment, all under the piercing light is breathtaking to see. Dietrich is simply marvelous in Shanghai Express. Anna May Wong's dazzling screen presence is irresistibly captivating in Shanghai Express. It's easy to see how the naturally beautiful Asian actress was fit for this dreamy noir picture. Wong's Hui Fei is a fantastic co-lead to Marlene Dietrich as she's another fallen lady getting used by awful men, yet she remains the heroine, ultimately saving the day. I loved seeing the first Chinese American movie star get to shine in black and white. Wong's dramatic skills are nuanced and realistic with a flawless empathy for Hui Fei's experience. Clive Brook is excellently cast as the stern and stuffy foil and romantic interest for Dietrich's effervescent heroine. His aristocratic English manner is funny next to Marlene Dietrich's enigmatic German seductress with her melancholic flirtiness. You immediately despise Brook for being so cold to the sweet Dietrich here, but his character is supposed to have conflicting feelings for Shanghai Lily. I should mention the dated yellowface in Shanghai Express by having white Swedish-American actor Warner Oland don a fu manchu as the Chinese villain Mr. Henry Chang. You really hate this guy for his abuse of power and cruel rape of women. He plays his hateful part with a serious calculating manner that is all the more sinister. Eugene Pallette is great as the conservative who complains about everything in a realistic depiction of Americans overseas as Sam Salt. Lawrence Grant is interesting as Reverend Mr. Carmichael, who learns to admire Shanghai Lily in a nice twist of faith themes. Emile Chautard is funny as the French Major Lenard, who befriends the multilingual Shanghai Lily. Dietrich gets to show off her perfect French accent often in Shanghai Express alongside her cute German accent when she speaks English. Lastly, Gustav von Seyffertitz appears as a quiet German dealer in a nice cameo role. Jules Furthman's writing is bleak, realistic, and fair with an open mind to all sorts of people on this train heading to Shanghai. Harry Hervey's original novel comes to life with vivid black and white cinematography and dedication to the harsh reality for women in the world. Furthman's words yield an honest perspective on how people from all walks of life judge ladies, working women, especially sex workers. You get this feminist message with two female leads, who are the real heroines that do brave deeds to save undeserving men from worse men. Having characters with varied backgrounds all judge, and some learn from their judgemental ways, while others continue to look down on women is fascinating. Shanghai Express is very ahead of its time. Travis Banton's gorgeous costumes are inspired looks for Marlene Dietrich and Anna May Wong. All the feathered and fuzzy dresses for Dietrich are quite fun. The costumes are as cute as the fluffy little dog a bitter old lady carries as played by Louise Closser Hale. The lovely Chinese outfit for Wong is particularly enchanting on her. All the music is nice and subtle throughout Shanghai Express. The sound design leans into natural sounds like the train engine, pistons firing, or smoke blowing noises for a striking effectiveness. In conclusion, Josef von Sternberg's dreary direction and Marlene Dietrich's darling dramatic actress ensure Shanghai Express will remain a classic film forever. Anna May Wong's inclusive role as an additional brave woman proves Asian ladies deserve to be cast as lead actresses in major motion pictures. Hopefully, we will get more films like Shanghai Express someday.

Review: In her time Marlene Dietrich was considered one of the most exciting stars in the world with her androgynous looks and German iciness and her appeal still applies today as she is a paragon of glamour and elegance. This is why I eagerly anticipated watching this film as she had paired with Josef von Sternberg previously on the fantastic Morocco (1930) and The Scarlet Empress (1934) but I found myself disappointed by this film. Unlike their previous collaborations this film felt the need to introduce an unnecessarily complex plot in favor of focusing on Dietrich's mysterious, alluring leading lady or further exploring her relationships with those around her. How odd then that this was their only collaboration together that was nominated for Best Picture. Famous courtesan "Shanghai Lily", Marlene Dietrich, boards a train from Peking to Shanghai during the Chinese Civil War. On board she encounters her former lover, the uptight British Captain Donald Harvey, Clive Brook, who was unaware of her identity under a new name and who knew her as "Madeleine", a woman who pushed him to display his devotion too early on in their relationship. They both realize that they still love one another. Their rekindled romance is interrupted when rebel army leader Chang, Warner Oland, boards the train and selects Harvey to take hostage as bait to take back his own aide. Harvey is going to perform surgery on a government official and despite his resistance to Chang he is taken by him. Chang attempts to pursue Madeleine but because of her love for Harvey she turns him down leading him to rape her friend Hui Fei, Anna May Wong, in revenge. Chang threatens to blind Harvey but Madeleine chooses to sacrifice herself for him before Hui Fei takes matters into her own hands and kills him. Films about lovers in tumultuous relationships who meet again after several years of separation and find that the passion is still alive are a favorite of mine as I enjoyed Separate Tables (1958) more than I really should have. Unfortunately the affair in this film was not particularly torrid and the grievances that the two characters had about the breakdown of their relation did not seem realistic. I did not need alcoholism or father issues but simply the man not wanting to commit, and a meek man at that, did not create fireworks on screen and they never really delved deeper into his reasoning for fearing commitment. Dietrich plays Dietrich here and it is always a pleasure to see her suffer in the most photogenic fashion and silently feel pain as the man she loves distances himself from her. Brook is less of a known quantity and in this film I found him to be stiff and rather like an older, British version, of Don Ameche in the 1940s with his performance being technically competent but lacking in any emotion. When serving as a romantic leading man this really puts a dampener on the emotional connection at the heart of the film. The plot of the film itself felt overloaded for a film that was just 80 minutes long as you have a mix of sexual assault, double crossing and murder in this short amount of time and none of them are focused on with enough detail. Had they really delved into the emotional damage caused by Hui Fei in the wake of her horrific rape instead of jumping to her murdering a man suddenly. The film seemed to use rape more as a plot device than as an issue it was genuinely concerned about and that inspired real disgust in me. I understand that it was the 1930s and if a film featured a star on the level of Dietrich and a plot with enough melodrama in it to keep chugging along for a reasonable amount of time it would get made and most likely made money but I just wanted more. Notably the film isn't shot particularly well as while Morocco and another Dietrich vehicle The Garden of Allah (1936) make fantastic use of the exotic surroundings and beautiful stars they feature the action in this film feels static. There is nothing really to recommend this film on as Dietrich has made better films and as a technical achievement the film hardly impresses.

Movie name: Shanghai Express
Review: Filled with iconic imagery and the narrative is surprisingly even handed for the 1930s. It throws a bunch of different people with various conflicting ideologies together but never really picks a side. There's also no moral center to the story, even the male lead is mostly just sarcastic.

Review: The Oscar for Best Cinematography is well earned. Plenty of absolutely stunning shots and very effective camera work. Deitrich, too, is stunning, though the script and some of the supporting performances leave a bit to be desired.

Review: "Murder on the Orient Express", minus the murder...whoops, spoke too soon... Takes a while to really get going, being slow and largely unfocused early on, but the intrigue and audience engagement really build as we watch these travelling civilians get caught in war diplomacy, becoming unwitting hostages. A romantic and forlorn ensemble drama that ends better than it starts.

Review: Dietrich is beautiful and a wonderful actress. Hint of wry humor

Movie name: Shanghai Express
Review: Marlene Dietrich is an absolute goddess in this film, let's just start with that. My god, there are just so many wonderful shots of her that it's hard to mention them all. Obviously the one where she waits in a darkened room, her face upturned to the light, fingers trembling as she wonders if Clive Brook's character will want to be with her again is beyond special. The one with her concerned face through a window, with open palm flat against the pane, is fantastic too. I also loved the scene where she stops Anna May Wong's character from committing suicide with a knife after she's been raped. And how about when she's talking with Brook over what happened to their relationship five years before, and while flicking his hat (which she's wearing) with her forefinger, playfully says "There's only one thing I wouldn't have done....I wouldn't have bobbed my hair." Dietrich plays both cool woman of the world, and broken-hearted/vulnerable very well. Her eyes dance around in many of her scenes, and director Josef von Sternberg wisely gets everything he can out of her, with interesting fashion and tight shots. Her character is expressed so perfectly early on when she tells an old lady (Louise Closser Hale) "Don't you find respectable people terribly ... dull?" In light of that, it's a bit ironic that the love of her life, Clive Brook, is so respectable and restrained. Brook's performance gets a fair bit of criticism, but to me, he turned in a strong performance. I loved how he expresses his anger and disdain in that eminently British way of his. An example is when he rebukes the missionary for questioning the morals of Dietrich and Wong by saying "You interest me, Mr. Carmichael. I'm not exactly irreligious, but being a physician, I sometimes wonder how a man like you can locate a soul, and having located it, diagnose its condition as rotten." Later he gives a thinly veiled threat to Mr. Chang, after Chang says the Governor General will be benefitted by his skill, by saying "I hope someday to have the pleasure of demonstrating my skill upon you." Brook has been thinking of Dietrich for five years and four weeks, ever since they parted, their "smash-up" as he calls it, but he talks about it stoically, and with dignity. Of course, the stoicism of both of them is taken to an extreme, and we wonder a bit why Dietrich doesn't just tell Brook why she acted as she did with Mr. Chang, in the present. There is something wonderfully old-fashioned about it, just doing the right thing, and having faith that the other person will either recognized it or just believe in you. There is so much feeling in these simple lines: Dietrich: "What makes you think I'm nervous?" Brook: "One thing, your hands are trembling." Dietrich: "That's because you touched me, Doc." The supporting cast is also strong, led by Anna May Wong, who I adore. She has less to work with here, but is riveting nonetheless. I loved every languid yet fierce look. I also loved how her character isn't a stereotype, speaking perfect English with that same touch of class and sophistication that Dietrich's does. She first shows this when she says "I must confess, I don't quite know the standard of respectability that you demand in your boarding house, Mrs. Haggerty," in polished tones. There is an international flair to the cast, with French and German mixed in with the Chinese of the locals, though the latter is incorrectly a southern dialect. I wasn't wild about Waner Oland playing Mr. Chang, the half-Chinese, half-European passenger who turns out to be the leader of the insurgents, but it's not an offensive portrayal. Hale's character is the funniest, as she fusses over her dog Waffles, hmmph's indignantly at a fellow-traveler, and says "I've never been so shocked in my life. The Chinese girl deserves all she's getting. But as for the other lady, well, I'm not going to say anything. Of all the brazen creatures, playing the gramophone. She's the most terrible woman I've ever met." That really cracked me up, the nerve, playing the gramophone. Aside from all of these wonderful characters, Josef von Sternberg's story-telling is tight, and the film is highly atmospheric. This one is a must-see from the pre-Code era.

Review: Shanghai Express is the story of a group of passengers traveling on a train through China. But it takes place during a time of political discord for China, and the passengers get mixed up in it all. I enjoyed the variety of characters and how they interacted with one another. In particular I appreciated the arc that the Reverend went through in the film. Marlene Dietrich has an intriguing quality that perfectly fits this role. Its impressive when she turns the corner and starts betraying emotions shes not willing to admit. Clive Brook is OK as her costar, but he is a bit flat. But I did like their interactions with one another, because you can sense the history between them even before they spell it out for us (which was kind of unnecessary.) The story doesnt always work for me. There are some sections where it feels like the movie is spinning its wheels waiting for the next big moment, and other times when it feels like its racing ahead without letting things breathe. However the climax is extremely satisfying and makes up for a lot of the flaws. Im happy that Ive seen Shanghai Express, because its a powerful tale even if it meanders a little along the way.

Review: I am not in love with this film, although it's admirable what von Sternberg was able to accomplish on a sound stage. The film really does feel like it was shot on location in China. Marlene Dietrich is amazing as usual, but although she has one of the more prominent roles, the film is really an ensemble story.

Review: One of the earliest adaptations of Ernest Hemingway that was to be a sure fire success at the Box Office with Rock Hudson. The film definitely too long hand many great qualities & due to the Author experiencing much of this the story had real authenticity. The stories gets going half way & has many twists many tragic. Critics seemed to strongly dislike the film but I haven't seen the original 1930's version though.

Movie name: A Farewell to Arms
Review: It's not as bad as Plan Nine from Outer Space, so it gets a little something for the effort. Neither Rock Hudson nor Jennifer Jones were the right actors to cast for this. Although the 1932 version has numerous problems, not the least of which is cramming Hemingway's novel into 85 minutes (the Reader's Digest very highly condensed version; you needed to read the novel to comprehend the film), Gary Cooper was much, much better as the leading actor and Helen Hayes was much more credible as leading actress even though she was 31 years old during filming (the character is a 24 year old nurse). In addition, at least the parts the 1932 version covered and didn't gloss over remained true to the novel. This 1957 version is of the epic length approaching what is needed for the dense novel, but it fails to convey the novel in many ways. Rock Hudson is too much lover and not enough soldier even though he wasn't too far off from the age of the character he portrayed. Jennifer Jones, at nearly 40, was much too old to play a 24 year old pregnant nurse. They're just not credible. That Jones was David O. Selznick's wife explains her nepotistic casting. Perhaps Hudson's sexual preferences ensured there would be no hanky-panky between them during filming. The screenplay takes enormous liberties with the novel, changing scenes and the plot, and not just a little. The result is a significant portion of the film in Italian and Swiss Alps being little more than a spectacular travelogue, when it's supposed to be in the midst of a horrific war, at least in the Italian portion of the Alps. It's as if they're on a honeymoon holiday with the war a continent away instead of finding love in the middle of one and trying to maintain it in what bits they can between all the intrusions from the war's horrors. In a significant insult to the novel's plot, Major Rinaldi (Vittorio de Sica), Henry's (Hudson) commanding officer is (wrongfully) executed for desertion, and this isn't the only substantial liberty Ben Hecht took with the novel. In the end, it's much too long on the romance and much too short on the war that is supposed to be going on around them, interfering with and frustrating their love, and that's what gets completely lost in this epic spectacle. Hemingway himself was appalled at what Selznick did to his novel. I'm not at all surprised it was rejected by the critics and the audiences when it was released, and that time has continued to reject it.

Movie name: A Farewell to Arms
Review: It's the only life I want. An English nurse has gone into celibacy and become a recluse of sorts after her husband was blown to pieces during World War 1. She encounters an American soldier fighting for the Italian army during the war and they start a torrid affair. They are separated by the war but the nurse becomes pregnant after their encounter. The soldier discovers this news and will stop at nothing to keep them together...but will the war tear them apart? "I never felt like a whore before." "You're not a whore." "I know, darling, but it's not nice to feel like one." Charles Vidor, director of Gilda, Hans Christain Anderson, Cover Girl, Love Me or Leave Me, The Joker is Wild, The Swan, She's No Lady, and Blind Alley, delivers Farwell to Arms. The storyline for this picture is amazing, compelling, and dramatic. The characters are very dynamic and the script is excellent. The acting is first rate and the cast includes Rock Hudson, Jennifer Jones, Vittorio De Sica, and Elaine Stritch. "No one likes to attack." "I like to attack." I came across this film on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) and decided to give it a chance. I found this film very entertaining and I am surprised this received such bad reviews. I would actually compare this to Anna Karenina. This picture receives a lot of bad reviews because of the performances by Jennifer Jones but I honestly thought she was fine and played the simple girl perfectly. Overall, I feel this is an underrated picture that is definitely worth your time. "What if she should die?" Grade: A

Review: Love this Movie, such a Heartfelt Tearjerker

Movie name: A Farewell to Arms
Review: It's just too long and of course very depressing. I agree with many critics that it doesn't capture the tone of war behind every scene and so becomes more a ho-hum romance between two sometimes strangely acted characters, one that seems emotionally unstable and the other sort of like a male model. OK, normally I like Jennifer Jones, but this film will always be remembered best as the last film Selznick ever did, and some say mercifully so.

Movie name: A Farewell to Arms
Review: I found this a bit of a damp squid of an epic. For a film produced by Selznick from a novel by Hemingway it should really be a lot better. The intensity of both love and war, that Selznick's Gone With the Wind committed so timelessly to celluloid, is lacking here. It's not good enough merely to look the part, and grand visuals can not make up for an uncomfortable lead pairing and a weak and meandering script.

I also wonder why the Swiss were burning snowmen New Year's Eve...? It was alright. I wonder what the version made 25 years before is like. Silly movies. Also didn't realize it was a love story instead of a war movie. Sad one at that. Shows how much I know.

Movie name: Cleopatra
Review: This movies problems and highlights can be summed up from one scene. The one where Cleopatra enters Rome. The scope, production value and special effects are amazing with good music to back it up as well. You feel the epicness. However as it keeps going 6-7 minutes strong you feel the problems start to seep in. This film loves to be self indulgent and bloated at times. Most of the acting say 70% of it is emotionless boring plot expose which is a HUGE amount for a 4 hour movie. Scenes go on way way way way too long. The pacing is the worst part of this film. It is bad. This shouldn't be 4 hours. Scenes that could be 90 seconds end up being 10 minute juggernauts weighed down by rambling plot expose and while the sets are lavish they aren't enough to offset the lack of epicness needed to justify holding on scenes for such a long time. A lot of this movie actually isn't that epic but more lavish. Overall it's disappointing to say the cinematography is just ok honestly. The other issue is the editing which is okay enough but needed more refinement. This feels like a Love Triangle/Love Tragedy mixed with a Historical Drama. Not a Biopic. Half this film Cleopatra isn't even the main focus. We never see her develop from a child to a young ruler which makes it hard to feel anything for her. Julius Cesar honestly has more focus in the first half surprisingly than anyone else and all his scenes are just boring plot expose constantly. Also, we learn more about the culture of Rome than we do the culture of Egypt which was a huge disappointment. I'm sure that was because many epics around this time focused on Rome but still. This needed to focus more on the life of Cleopatra and show her rise rather than part of a love triangle. It really feels like this is a film where Cleopatra is the Liaison for historical events. Not the main focus. This is why the 2nd half is better aside from the cool ship fight. It focuses more on Cleopatra and her ambitions. Not Romes. Also this needed much more narration montages to cut the run time down as well. I can't really recommend to anyone except die hard Taylor/Burton fans. There's enough here where I can't call this a bad film but it definitely isn't good and it's one of the most disappointing ones for sure.

Movie name: William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream
Review: A fun and well updated version of the play. There are some questionably strange choices in attempting to contemporise this and make it work in cinematic form but they largely work. Production wise this is sumptious to look at and the soundtrack works beautifully. The star studded cast largely cope well with standouts being Kline who is superb as bottom and Stanley Tucci as Puck. All in all its a successful production of the Bards classic, especially as it's not a play that particularly lends itself to this medium. That said I'm not sure Shakespeare purists will be as enamoured and due to the prose itself I doubt it'll convert many who weren't already familiar with the play, so I'm not sure who the target audience for this will actually be. Despite enjoying this myself, it's worth stating that I watched this with my wife who gave up with it about 40 minutes in as the prose simply wasn't for her and the humour simply wasn't to her taste. Never the less it's an attempt to make Shakespeare accessible to the masses and whilst I'm not sure it wholly achieves that aim, it's laudible in its intention and effort.

Movie name: William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream
Review: Looking down the cast list before watching this film, I did not think that it would be Kevin Kline that would end up the show-stealer, but here we are. Hoffman's updated adaptation of the Shakespeare classic may not win over the purists with its altered setting and rather lighthearted tone, but it is for large sections a rather enjoyable film, particularly when the actors are allowed to get lost in the fun they are having with their roles. The source material doesn't necessarily lend itslf well to uniform character development given the size of the cast and the time restrictions of a feature-length film, but those that get the opportunity to shine do so, particularly Kline's Bottom and Tucci's Puck. Kline's exuberance leaps off the screen and delivers energy that is sorely lacking from conventional adaptations of period theater; his exaggerated theatrics in the final performance are wonderfully lively. The film comes in fits and starts, but when it's moving you'll be plenty entertained. (3/5)

Movie name: William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream
Review: I was happy to see so illustrious a cast in any movie as most of the praise I would give the movie is directly for their performances and really nothing else whatsoever. Pfeiffer & Kline both did stand-out jobs (though Kline is not a good replacement for the '35 version's Cagney, whose performance was far superior) and Bale is among my favorite actors. The problems I had with this movie were really no fault of its own as this play is just very poor material for film adaptation; had I not seen other versions, read through the plot on Wikipedia and had subtitles on I would've quickly become lost in the movie's complicated-but-uneventful plot & dogged fixation with having the actors speak in Shakespearean verse. I did like that they inserted some dad-joke-level comedy with the donkey mannerisms but I was absolutely blown away that the decision to insert bicycles into the plot was not at some point struck down by the studio. There's rarely been a dumber idea for a gimmick and they didn't use them to change the plot whatsoever, they were just sort of there to prevent the audience from suspending their disbelief. Truly mind-boggling.

Review: Not amazing, but enough fun that I watch it often. For me the most enjoyable performances were the players (Kevin Kline, Roger Rees, Max Wright, Gregory Jbara, Sam Rockwell), and Stanley Tucci as Puck. The rest were take-it-or-leave-it, they did well enough, but most of the pleasure of this movie comes from the above performances. I also really enjoy the music, both the original score, and several opera selections that seem to fit in really well (to my mind). It's a pleasant and comfortable movie to watch.

Review: Michael Hoffman's adroit adaptation of the Bard's most eccentric comedy showcases wonderful sets, beautiful costumes, terrific production values, and a strong affection for the source material. Kevin Kline's Bottom steals every scene that he's in, but there's also solid acting by Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Anna Friel, Stanley Tucci, Dominic West, Calista Flockhart, and Christian Bale. There's no shortage of cinematic translations of A Midsummer Night's Dream out there, but this version's mixture of mirth, myth, bicycles, and body glitter manages to leave a unique impression.

Review: I've always believed that you cannot and should not make a film adaptation of Shakespeare's work. It's not the language style or the settings. It's all because of the fact that Shakespeare's plays are written in a way where every character can be performed in many, many, many different styles, and these styles are used thousands of times every year in America to this day. To take Hollywood heartthrobs and to through them in front of a camera to perform something that has been performed so many times by so many different people is honestly a shame to me. But... the mistake was made in 1999, and we can at least agree that the cinematography was decent, and that the sets were fun to look at. Even with the use of Shakespeare's magnificent language, however, the chemistry between the actors do not fulfill the interest in the story, and in this situation that's the worst mistake you could ever make in a film production. The conclusion is this: either go see the story performed on stage, or watch all the other film adaptations that will occur in the future roll in. It'll be entertaining either way.

Review: Bottom is absolutely hilarious. A total show off, he seem to loves the extra attention

Movie name: William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream
Review: A Midsummer Night's Dream is a fun adaptation of Shakespeare's play, featuring mostly solid performances across the board (Most notably Kevin Kline as Nick Bottom and Stanley Tucci as Puck), the payoff of moving the setting to the late 1800's, and being generally faithful to the source material. Verdict: B

Review: Faithful to both the language and visionary of Shakespeare's with fine performances, but for some reason the film became incomprehensible and less compelling as it progresses to be somewhat torturous at not understanding what's going on or what they're trying to say. This adaptation is for those who admire Shakespeare's work with complete understanding. (B-)

Movie name: Anthony Adverse
Review: Almost unwatchable: I'm on a quest to watch every Best-Picture winning or nominated film (there are 599 of them, fwiw, 1929's "The Patriot" being lost forever). Sometimes that quest has teed up unexpected gems. "The Best Years of our Lives," for one. "The Awful Truth" for another. And sometimes it tees up absolute horrors, and "Anthony Adverse" might be the worst yet. Painfully long, agonizingly melodramatic, the film spans a few decades and three continents. Along the way, agreeable orphan Anthony transforms into depressed mini-despot, only to return to form quite quickly after returning to Europe. Frederic March performs adequately, but Claude Rains, Gale Sondergaard and Steffi Duna put on a master class of over-acting, Rains being by far the most malignant. When he and his henchman share a laugh over the birth of Anthony, it makes Mike Myer's Dr Evil look subtle. This is truly one of the worst films I've ever seen, and my guess is that it made the Oscar-nominee list because of its breadth and ambition, much like "Around the World in 80 Days" a few decades later. (#441 in my "watch all Best Picture Nominees" bucket list)

Review: I have not read the largely forgotten book on which this movie is based. My favorite films are from the early 30's to the mid 40's. The cast in this film is stellar, including some of my favorite leads and supporting actors. I love costume dramas and adventures set in exotic places. However, with all of those factors to prejudice me in favor of Anthony Adverse, I was hugely disappointed. The plot seems okay. The sets and costumes are excellent. The cast, as I already mentioned, is stellar (in the credits!). The score seems appropriate. The expensive production shows throughout. The reason this film is so unsatisfying is rather puzzling. I think it may be one of those times everybody from the director on down was simply going through the motions. Hard to believe, given the cast. But they all seem so - not just two-dimensional, but - lifeless. Perhaps, as one other reviewer suggests, this film would have been better if de Havilland had been teamed with Errol Flynn instead of Frederic March. I don't remember seeing Flynn ever give a less than energetic performance. Frederic March, one of America's greats, fails to create a character that I could like, sympathize with or root for with any enthusiasm. In fact enthusiasm is what he seems to lack in this role. Olivia de Havilland is somewhat better, but this is one of her least impressive performances. Gale Sondergaard did very little to receive an academy award. The appearances of Louis Heyward and Anita Louise are entirely too short. I like both, and I would have liked more of them and less of March and de Havilland. Perhaps they should have reversed roles... Edmund Gwenn delivers a typically endearing performance in a typical Edmund Gwenn role. Henry O'Neill is usually very interesting, because he plays both sides of the fence - both good and bad guys. Here, his father Xavier is far more enjoyable than Pedro De Cordoba's Father Francoise. The only bright spot in this under-achieving ensemble is Claude Rains. He, too, plays both good and bad guys. Here he is an aristocratic charmer and schemer - despicable and deceitful. He is great! In the scene where he laughs demonically, he sends a chill up my spine. Thank you, Mr. Rains, for delivering a great, under-appreciated performance, in an otherwise deservedly forgotten film.

Review: Adverse buys and sells slaves in Africa for several years -- seemingly without conscience, and all for money. He personally directs the selling of poor innocent black men and women to whoever can pay and condemns them to a life of servitude to their new masters. This is not a film to be admired. Adverse travels all over the world and Napoleon Bonaparte is even thrown in, but nothing can forgive his years of slave trading and the black stain on his mind and heart.

Review: The best movie score ever composed!

Movie name: Anthony Adverse
Review: Anthony Adverse is a gigantic epic costume drama/adventure film that was made at a time when a rigid production code was in place. If we look at the film within the confines of that production code we can see something beautiful yet watered down from its source material. The novel created quite the splash upon its release in 1933 and sold copious amounts of copies to become the bestelling novel of all time; replaced three years later by Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind. Fredric March is our leading man here and he triumphantly portrays the troubled Adverse through his adult years. Olivia DeHavilland is stunning as his forgotten wife and there is scene chewing support galore from the likes of Edmund Gwenn, Claude Rains, and Gale Sondergaard (who won the first ever Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance). The film takes through a large amount of time and we travel to several different countries within that timeframe including Cuba and somewhere in Africa. What the film lacks in cohesion it makes up for in gorgeous black and white cinematography and flawless costume sets. It may not be remembered as one of Hollywood's great epic films but it should still be given a chance to take its place as one of its most extravagant.

Review: Two words: Bo and ring. Long, tedious, melodramatic, drippy music score. Fortunately, the following year (1937), Fredric March got not one but two opportunities to send up such meretricious media malarkey, both in Technicolor no less: "Nothing Sacred" and the original (and best) version of "A Star is Born."

Movie name: Anthony Adverse
Review: Generally forgettable movie for which follows the adventures of the title character (Fredric March), who gets involved with many characters during both his childhood and as an adult. He hops from job to during a ten-year period and eventually fall in love a head cook's wife (Olivia de Havilland). Most people would regard this as one of the worst movies to be nominated for Best Picture. It is not very memorable, but it has nice costumes and peculiar characters that bring it along through its 139 minute running time. Other than that, however, not much else in the offering. Even Claude Rains is not that great. Again, I say it for this movie as well, mediocre at best.

It had great locations good acting talent but it just didn't work & midway the film got really slow & dragged heavily. The physicality's of this film are great, ie great costume design & cinematography but as I well know it takes a lot more than that. Olivia DeHavilland is a sensation though in a sense the films only saving grace....

Review: Well, it's a very weak academy award nominee, but it's not too bad. It's long, boring, and badly plotted with some poor characterization-- a lot of Anthony's character development is assumed to have occurred, rather than have ogranically grown. But it has solid acting and a grand feel that makes it clear why it was nominated. Not a must see, but not a waste of time (even it it is about 30 mins too long, as most of the first half hour could have been cut).

Review: Felt like over 2 hours. The acting isn't good at all. Marlene is shockingly not that good here. It feels like she's over the top half the time and other times wooden and just gazing into the camera like she just saw King Kong. There is no chemistry at all between the two leads as well and is super stilted along with pretty much all the other actors in this. The music is terrible and I actively hated it. There is NONSTOP music playing in this and it becomes ear grating, makes things even MORE boring, and just never stops. The cinematography and editing isn't good and the pacing is somehow terrible. This is the earliest color film I've ever seen and it's gorgous in certain shots and there is plenty of prodction value. But there is no life to any performances, most of the time the direction is super basic, and scenes just meander terribly. I don't really get the point of this overall. I think it's about being torn between love for the Church and for a significant other. But it never works. It feels like stuff just happens once they meet. The scene where they meet when the indian dancers are there sums up the problems here perfectly. Gorgous colors that pop, Marlene is beautiful, tons of production value, but it just goes on and on with no real point or takes forever to get to it with actors who look bored or over the top. It reminds of me of Heaven's Gate honestly at times with a simliar problem. And the dialouge just feels very meandering which I don't know if it's because of poor delivery or the music making it worse. Either way skip this.

Review: Star-cast melodrama in an Oriental setting is slow-going, and the romance is quite absurd, but it's all photographed in glorious color and beautiful settings.

Review: I slept through the last half of this relatively short (85 minutes) film the first time I saw this: I was uncertain of the plot. But upon a second viewing, I realized the real problem for me: Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer - both fine actors - performed as if they really didn't want to be in this, the 3rd version of the film-as per another reviewer)- or perhaps they were overshadowed by Selnick's desperation for a BIG FILM. It's true this was made during the heyday of studio powers and contract players. And no doubt producer David O. Selznick goes for a BIG FILM: big music, nice sets, and beautiful costumes for Dietrich. But the story is a simple romance (reminded me of "Marty") and everything about the romance is just overshadowed. A touching, lovely final scene, though, is done simply and is the outstanding scene of the film. Sometimes, keeping things simple is best. One thing stood out as just wrong: a sultry dance by a lady of unusual beauty is supposedly one of seduction, but frankly I felt scared: her close-ups I think had been lit odd, maybe it was her make-up, but she looked a tad too masculine in said close-ups. Today, that'd be fine, but I don't think that was the intention in 1936. For fans of Dietrich and Boyer and older movies.

Review: What a hilarious yarn of ill-starred romance in an exotic location. The wedding of Boyer to Dietrich totally caught me by surprise. I didnâ(TM)t even think they were getting along. Heâ(TM)s supposed to be a Trappist monk on the run, so I suppose itâ(TM)s understandable he doesnâ(TM)t have much to say for himself. And he displays remarkable acting chops by, alternately, breaking a sweat and shedding a tear on camera. This is a dumb blonde of a movie: good looking but very silly.

Review: How can this wonderful film be failed! I loved it and I really think the movie is underrated. The cinematography is one of the best in history, same for the art direction, costumes and specially Marlene Dietrich! Certainly Boyer was a bad actor, but the film is incredible and the restoration it recently had, makes it look like new.

Review: Here we have Domini (Marlene Dietrich) in the desert in love with Boris (Charles Boyer) who is a Trappist monk. They get married, and suddenly a french legionnaire who recognises Boris from the past, appears and reveals a secret about Boris. Therefor Boris leaves Domini in agony. Does is sound interesting? I'll tell you what; it isn't! Not worth watching unless you are a diehard Marlene Dietrich-fan. Despite it's all star cast with; Marlene Dietrich, Charles Boyer, C. Aubrey Smith, John Carradine, and Basil Rathbone the movie is incredibly dull, and the whole thing just feels lazy directed, unengaging, and made by people who trust the actors stardome too much. Distustingly cheesy as well. Not worth seeing, specially not if you are just getting custummed to Marlene Dietrich's movies.

Review: Oodles of golden age-style melodrama in glorious Technicolor (R), but also some kickass acting and heartstring tuggage. I defy you watch it and not clutch your pained chest by the time it ends. No singing by Marlene, but somehow that made her character more dignified. She also wears some fabulous outfits, naturally. In short, an amazing film that is totally worth it, especially if you have doubts about Marlene Dietrich's acting chops.

Review: In terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding! I had no idea that Technicolor came out so early. Although I didn't like the ending, entire movie is fantastic and makes me wish that I was in North Africa. The cast is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is big plus and of course she is so alluring and I enjoyed watching her in this flick. Basil Rathbone is perfect in this movie. I couldn't get over the scenery and the sets... The hotel, the palm trees, the desert, it's all there... the legionnaires bring a "Beau Geste" feeling to the film. They certainly don't make movies like these anymore.

Review: 5.5/10. Tecnically it is a tremendous film, especially the cinematography. The color is excellent and it has a moving score. Great costumes. But the writing and story are very hokey, at times quite bad. But the presence of Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer help tremendously.

Movie name: The Good Earth
Review: In the 30s and 40s, MGM had a penchant for (then) contemporary Chinese-oriented stories ('The Son-Daughter', 'Dragon Seed', 'Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo', etc.), and whether this was a preference, or whether there were just a lot of Chinese-design sets to keep occupied at the studio, the results were strangely moving. 'The Good Earth' is of course the finest of its genre, for any number of reasons. From the very beginning of the picture, right after the lion's roar, we see the poignant tribute to Irving Thalberg, and we know that we are embarking on an important viewing experience. The scope of the story is very wide, and the filmmakers are up for the task. I was always struck by the abruptness of the final scene, but its power and beauty form an excellent example of the art achieved within the often cynical Hollywood film factory. And Lotus - the strangeness of her, and her dance, contrasted with the goodness of O-lan! Aside from the oft-mentioned attributes of acting, photography and special effects, a major element in 'The Good Earth' is the score. Herbert Stothart may not be in the ranks of Hollywood's 'mighty handful' (Alfred Newman, Steiner, Tiomkin, Waxman, Herrmann), but his 'MGM-sound' scores regularly deliver the goods. True, Stothart had no hesitation in applying the syrup at first opportunity (one can imagine Louis B. Mayer positively ordering it), but in this picture, syrup gives way to sympathy. One of the pleasures of Hollywood's Golden Age films is that all the elements of a given film support each other, and great scores support not only the characters, but the entire film. Stothart's score is so sympathetic and so sincere, from the Main Title all the way through, and it enhances the story and the performances so naturally and at times transparently, that it must be considered a classic score. No great 'tunes' specifically, but plenty of effective mood, atmosphere and unabashed emotion. Many of today's audiences may find little to enjoy in such a combination, or they may be embarrassed by it, but I revel in it, as cinema such as this, which is delivered with such heart and good will is, especially in these times, nothing short of a gift. The issue of non-Chinese playing Chinese characters has already been discussed on these pages, but I can only add: please, viewers, consider the film within the era that it was produced. The same kind of incongruity still happens today, perhaps not so much racially, but certainly culturally: Brad Pitt in 'Seven Years in Tibet', Keanu Reeves in 'Little Buddha', and other Americans getting plum roles in British-originated stories that become Hollywoodized, etc. When making 'Bhowani Junction', George Cukor considered using Indian actors, but vetoed any candidates in favor of familiar Hollywood faces. Never mind that in the 50s, as today, India had a huge film industry. It's just that those actors didn't fit into the Hollywood scheme of things. That speaks of box office more than political incorrectness. There is no doubt that fine actors like Philip Ahn should have gotten lead roles in pictures like 'The Good Earth', but at least we can enjoy them in supporting roles which carry a lot of weight in their own right. As time goes on, the context of past eras fades, while the films themselves, the really good ones, live on. There's plenty of opportunity for revisionist theses about issues like racial inequality in 1930s Hollywood, but for 138 minutes, it is compelling and moving to absorb onesself in the story and the atmosphere of 'The Good Earth'.

Review: 1937 was not what you would call one of the greatest years in cinematic history, unlike 1939 or 1941, however it did produce one of the greatest films all time in Make Way for Tomorrow (1937). In the same year the very mediocre film The Good Earth was released and it earned Luise Rainer her second of two Academy Awards for her performance as O-Lan. Obviously you have to get past the hugely offensive sight of European American actors and actresses in yellow face but as a film from this era I would say it is not terrible. I would not urge anybody who is a casual film fan to watch this because it is a bit of a slog when viewed through a modern lens but if you consider the fact that it made significant advances at the time you can mine some appreciation out of it. Married couple O-Lan, Luise Rainer, and Wang Lung, Paul Muni, struggle to survive after the event of a drought that drives O-Lan to kill their second child because they will not be able to support her. The family go to the city in order to find work but the drought later ends while they are there and they want to return but do not have the means to. Miraculously, O-Lan is able to pick up a large bag of diamonds which give her family the ability to return the farm they grew up on. The relationship between O-Lan and Wang Lung is threatened when he develops an obsessive attraction to Lotus, Lilly Tosch, who brushes off his affections as he neglects his devoted wife. After Lotus has an affair with their son he impetuously banishes him but a locust swarm causes him to return to his senses and fall back in love with his wife right before she passes away. Like many films this movie chooses to portray a long suffering woman as it's protagonist while cutting a lot of slack for it's male protagonist who chooses to abuse her. I don't enjoy this plotline because it implies that a woman could only really be good if she experienced intense suffering, you often see women win Academy Awards for performances of this type, and that men should always be forgiven for their mistreatment of this sort of women. This film was also made in the 1930s and so it is obviously going to be more sexist than the average modern film of this type. If you don't want to see this sort of retrograde treatment of women then you should stay away from modern superhero films and probably this film. Moving beyond it's obvious issues the film had some decent moments buried amongst the boredom of other scenes. I enjoyed watching Wang Lung get tortured while in the city, my feelings about the character were mostly negative, in addition to appreciating Rainer's work in early scenes despite the thick make up plastered onto her face which mostly obscure the expressions she makes. These were too few and far between to be truly rewarding but this did move the film above being a complete failure and I was looking for something to appreciate amidst some more difficult to watch films. I do realize that Jezebel (1938), which I watched last week, was a lot stronger than this film and I probably marked it too tough when considering the limitations of this time period. The difficulties of making a film during this period must be factored in when you elevate how well the film works and though I do not feel passionate about the story this film tries to tell I do appreciate it's attempts to produce a fascinating cinematic experience for the audiences of 1937. If you want to see a great female performance from 1937 you could venture to watch Stella Dallas (1937) which features one of the best Barbara Stanwyck performances ever seen along with her work in The Lady Eve (1941) and of course Double Indemnity (1944). I think that Stanwyck would have been more deserving of the award than Rainer not only because she gives the best performance in the category but because Stanwyck, one of the best actresses of the 1940s, should have an Academy Award and faced stronger competition in later years.

Review: such a racist movie with all these yellow faced cast. Albert Lewin, is the MGM producer in charge of casting this film.Lewin and MGM were unlikely to hire any Chinese-Americans for major roles. "In his reports on ... other Chinese actors," Hodges writes, "Lewin consistently argued that, despite their ethnicity, they did not fit his conception of what Chinese people looked like." What were they supposed to look like? This is Hollywood racism at its peak.

Review: This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This sexist, racist film shouldn't have seen the light of day, let alone be Oscar worthy. After the full 2 hours and 18 minutes, I finished the film not knowing why I had watched it. It's dull and boring, and the lackluster wife, O-lan, simply lives for her husband. She has no individual purpose, no drive, and no motivation beyond helping her husband. At one point, she even offers to sell her daughter just so her beloved husband can go home, and he proceeds to repay her by buying himself a second wife. This movie isn't worth your time. Please don't watch it.

Review: A prime example of why I so often don't like highly regarded oldies. Setting aside the goofiness of the Americans playing Chinese characters, it's just a dog's breakfast of a movie. The acting is really bad. Luise Rainer is particularly unbearable - and she actually won an Oscar. There are ludicrous plot turns, awful characters and characterizations. There are some redeeming points but all I can say is, man, I hope the book is much better. 3.9 out of 10

Movie name: The Good Earth
Review: Rural China, 1930s. A farmer, Wang (played by Paul Muni), is given a small plot of land by his father. Soon after he marries O-Lan (Luise Rainer) in an arranged marriage. Things go well: not only does he buy more land but he and his wife have three children. Then famine strikes the land and they are forced to move to the city, doing anything to stay alive. It looks like Wang and his family have to start all over again. An interesting social and moral tale, based on Pearl Buck's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Quite epic in its span and scale. The main theme of life's vagaries, rolling with them and recovering from them is well told. The theme of legacies and succession was also done well. The moral themes - greed, theft - were touched upon but not explored too well nor extensively. Solid work by Paul Muni in the lead role. Luise Rainer deserved her Oscar for playing O-Lan - she is fantastic in the role.

Movie name: The Good Earth
Review: The Good Earth, thanks in part to its source material, is an emotionally effective historical drama, taking realistic but occasionally unexpected turns throughout the plot, and featuring an especially exciting climax, however the acting is problematic, especially by today's political standards, yet the substance of the script can make up for some of this - even by those same political standards. It comes down to being a much shorter and simpler alternative to Gone with the Wind, which is not a bad thing by any stretch.

Movie name: The Good Earth
Review: While a great black and white epic production, it's hard to get past the caucasians playing asians. All the major roles are played by caucasians and for me just weren't believable. I guess it's more a look at what Hollywood and society was like in general in the 1930's, that asian roles went to white actors and no one thought there was anything wrong with it.

Movie name: The Good Earth
Review: Starring Paul Muni and Luise Rainer. Irving Thalberg did right by Pearl Buck with this faithful adaptation of her novel about a Chinese farming family. Through his vision, persistence and no small amount of money, Thalberg was able to produce an amazing facsimile of the grueling hardships faced by the simple farming family, including famine, revolution and swarms of locusts. Thalberg died suddenly before the production finished, and a special Academy Award was named in his honor. Directed by Sam Wood.

Movie name: The Good Earth
Review: Watching it now with non-Chinese actors playing Chinese people is a bit silly, but considering the time it was made, it isn't as a big deal. This is a story about appreciating what you have when you have nothing and appreciating what you have when you have everything. Luise Rainer won her second of back-to-back Best Actress Oscars in her emotional and brilliant performance as the humble and faithful wife O-Lan. Grade: A-

Movie name: The Good Earth
Review: The Good Earth is a well-acted and well-crafted cautionary tale about the perils of greed.

Movie name: The Good Earth
Review: Long and slow but entertaining if you stick with it. Muni as was his usual practice when buried under makeup slightly hammy but less so than when he played Zola or Pasteur. He does what he can to humanize a basically thoughtless, selfish and reprehensible man although he is not for one instant believable as an Asian. Someone who isn't hammy is Luise Rainer in a beautifully judged performance that won a richly deserved Oscar. She makes the rest of the sometimes ponderous film worth watching.

Review: By far the best musical I have ever seen. The soundtrack to this, I still listen to in its entirety every other day. Lady gaga really surprised me

Movie name: A Star Is Born
Review: For me, "A Star Is Born" (2018) is an incredibly captivating musical film, and it's no surprise why it has won over audiences and critics worldwide. The storyline flows so smoothly, giving us a deep, emotional look into the lives of Jackson Maine (played by Bradley Cooper) and Ally (played by Lady Gaga). This film takes you along on their journey—both in love and music—and makes you feel truly connected to and empathetic toward the complexities of these characters. The soundtrack is amazing, especially the song "Shallow," which is iconic in its own right. This song beautifully reflects the connection between the characters, and the other songs are equally powerful, filled with emotion that complements each scene perfectly. As for the ending, I felt that it offered a sharp critique of the modern music industry while addressing issues like depression and the pressure artists face. This added a lot of depth to the film, giving me insight into some often-overlooked realities. And as for Lady Gaga in the role of Ally, she absolutely exceeded expectations. She conveyed emotion so naturally, both in her acting and singing, making Ally feel like a real, relatable character.

Movie name: A Star Is Born
Review: “A Star Is Born” falls flat, failing to live up to the hype. Gaga’s performance feels forced and unconvincing, making it hard to connect with her character. The pacing is slow, dragging the movie into boredom. The only saving grace is Bradley Cooper’s solid performance and the standout song, but even that can’t carry the film to success. Disappointing overall.

Review: Shines brighter and hits harder the first time viewing. Well acted and shot, it does fall into some of the pitfalls of the ‘tragic rock star’ cliches but the added dynamic of the relationship between the two rock stars and their parallel stories mostly negates those.

Movie name: A Star Is Born
Review: There is an aspect of sadness that permeates the film, from the opening scene: Anyone who's seen any of the previous incarnations knows that the film will end in sadness; the only question is how. Cooper's worn-out alcoholism telegraphs his ending throughout the film, although the curveball at the end was actually unexpected. What gets us through the gloom is Lady Gaga's amazing performance. Not really a fan of her music, but WOW she can act. Her arc is amazing. Unfortunately I watched the first half of this film on an airplane, where the language had been adjusted to PG-13. The plane landed, I rented it, and watched the rest, and thank heavens, had the bathroom scene been reduced to 15 "frigs" I think I might have laughed out loud. This is the best of the four, hands down. [#449 of by "Best Picture" Bucket List]

Review: not as bad as the critics said in the 1970's quite exquisite sets, and costumes, and some great dance numbers. This films needs to be released on DVD. It is from MGM, it has Turned up on TNT but many many decades ago like the 90's. I have never seen this on TCM. I have an old VHS that I taped in the 90's of this film, that is how I saw it. Warner Archive should put this out.

Review: Wake me up when it's finished! So slow, and boring as hell... I fell asleep. To have an African boy playing Heathcliff was just bloody ridiculous in my opinion!

Review: One of several film adaptations of Emily Bronte's famous classic novel, this 2011 film by Andrea Arnold is a heartbreaking story of romance happening in a backdrop of prejudice, physical and mental cruelty, betrayal, and misunderstanding, with solid performances.

Review: It's not good at all, dull and misery atmosphere with the lack of music. A lot of silence

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: So I watched Wuterhing heights for the first time & then I went onto to Wikipedia to read about the original story line. I was expecting to find a similar story line to this film, but that wasn't the case. I'm not sure I understand why this version has changed the original story line to include a black orphan boy who speaks no English and is racially insulted by this adopted brother and others around him. This isn't even a thing in the original story. No mention that Heathcliff was an African orphan, who spoke no English & was racially abused by the families. I think this has completely defected from the original story, so for that I am marking this film as a 3. It was good, it kept my attention but not happy that the original was completely changed to include the topic of racism & a character Heathcliff who didn't speak English and wasn't from England. This has not followed the original at all. Sorry I like stories to be told as they were originally written by the author.

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: Beautiful to look at but not much happened. No soundtrack that I can recall. I'd say it was the most boring drama interspersed with a nature documentary.

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: This movie was boring as hell, i think the director prioritize the visuals more than the script on this movie. Cathy and Heathcliff has 0 chemistry on this movie. The shaky camera when the characters were running really makes me dizzy, i understand that sometimes shaky cameras when the characters were running adds realistic effect so i as an audience can feel like i'm involved in this scene (hope this makes sense.) but the shaky camera was so SHAKY and i feel like throwing up watching the running scenes. I feel like this movie would be better if it followed the book (like really... followed the book, from the start to the end, from how Mrs. Nelly were the one who narrated the story and Catherine Earnshaw's daughter story. (i do not support the incest) )

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: The script is weak, the actors are bad, and the movie doesn't reflect the idea of the book.

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: A masterpiece. I think the roughening up of the traditional classic novel film was a bold, genius move, and teenage versions of Cathy and Heathcliff were wonderful. I think the negative reviewers are just not brave enough to face the grit and sensusality of of a truly gothic and romantic aesthetic, which is a shame. The one letdown is a timid, rail-thin and languid Kaya Scodelario, who as others have commented here, didn't match the perfect teenage Cathy in any way. Many have commented on the two minutes of abuse to dog actors: I don't know how you survive a typical fim on Netflix if you can't watch that. As for the choice of a black character, this subtle twist of the original plot and narrative was done compellingly. I love Andrea Arnold but didn't know she directed it until after I watched it.

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: There was no point for all the animal abuse in the movie. They skipped key things that could have shown Heathcliff's cold side, and instead just let him aimlessly murder animals.

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: Dark and intense adaptation is at best evoking passion and dread from the naturalistic and beautiful comprehension of the Yorkshire moors; in comparison, the actual story fades behind the visual brilliance.

Review: The novel was great but i am not ahuge fan of the movie

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: This movie is so gross and horrific that It made me want to scream.

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: As far as adaptations go this is the worst and rips out the beautiful, tormented soul of the novel. Andrea Arnold's film does have some redeeming qualities: she captures the wild beautiful landscapes and nature of the moors stunningly and Heathcliff and Cathy (young and a little bit less young) are good (and really beautiful people). The problem is they feel like they aren't in a period drama. The entire film feels too modern but in period dress. I can appreciate the new path Arnold was trying to take with Heathcliff being a black man, but while there was build up there wasn't follow through to see where that change would lead. I found many changes, including the liberal use of the "N word," to be shocking and upsetting and just for the shock value. The ending was too abrupt to deliver a conclusion to this change. There was plenty of time to have one if they'd cut out some of the gratuitous shots of people's hair shot with a hand camera.

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: I watched for about 25 minutes, then I could no longer bear witnessing one of the best novels of all time turned into this drivel. It did have some nice moments - the fingering of a feather, the sun and wind in young Cathy's hair - but a movie has got to be more than that. Some conversation would help.

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: I once followed the train tracks by my house east into the overgrown dense foliage. The air was thick and the swell of early June crept into my nose something fierce. I could hear the cicadas rattling about within the trees that overlapped what was left of the path. I walked a mile until i came across the carcass of what looked like a dead dog rotting away beneath an old weathered tree. It's matted fur decomposing as maggots and creepy crawlies devoured what was left it. I just stared at it for a 10 minutes then felt ill to my stomach... I remember that day vividly for some reason. it was dreamlike yet so distinct.... just like this movie.? -(YOUTUBE USER, NULL)

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: Rarely, outside of the SCI-fi/SuperHero/Action eye candy genre, do I watch a movie on the tele and wish I had seen it on the big screen. This is one of the exceptions. The best thing about this movie are the beautiful vistas of the Yorkshire country. Wind-whipped and deep, the land is as beautiful as it is wild and the director pulls no punches when showing the scenes to the audience. The dripping of the water through the peat moss, the tapping of the trees on windows and the constant hum of wind through thrush only add to the experience. The result is so honest one couldn't be blamed for thinking they need a coat to keep out the chill. The movie itself is at times emotionally overbearing but considering the times and the secluded nature of the story that can be forgiven. All of this, combined with the slow pace interrupted with sharp explosions of strange activity, leads to an overall feeling of uncertainty. The acting is better than fair but at some times confusing. The plot introduces, for the first time, the character of Heathcliff having African origins and considering the times we live in now makes more sense than had it been a white street urchin as portrayed in various other rendition of Bronte's classic. This is certainly worth the watch on a cold rainy night and if somehow you can see this on the big screen its worth the dollars spent.

Movie name: Wuthering Heights
Review: Wuthering Heights is my favorite novel. Why was Kaya Scodelario given the chance to ruin this? She is not a good actress. She is incredibly boring and lifeless. She is not appealing in any way. She is droll and so amazingly boring.

Review: 1939 HOLLYWOODS BEST YEAR?! DEFINITELY TRULY A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE! MOST SUCCESSFUL FILM/MOVIE ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION.

Movie name: Gone With the Wind
Review: This movie is seriously overrated. It's too long, Vivien Leigh's acting is nothing wonderful (but it's not bad), and the movie tries to paint slavers and racists in positive light. It just doesn't work. Though I most say, Clark Gable does a decent job as Rhett.

Movie name: Gone With the Wind
Review: Gone With the Wind provides escapism for the audience, offering a dream they yearn for. Despite its unconventional length of almost 4 hours, it is surprisingly moving and captivating. Although the film was made during the economic hardship of the Depression era, it thrived in an opposite economic state, with a staggering budget of $4 million in 1939. As the saying goes, when the economy is in recession, art thrives. The lavish costumes, set design, and the use of Technicolor—which was extremely expensive at the time—make it stand out and enhance the storytelling. I have great respect for the filmmakers and their masterpiece, for pushing the boundaries of filmmaking during such difficult times, embracing a daring, dream-like spirit. Similarly, Scarlett’s resilience and survival are inspiring, particularly for women, as she embodies independence. The film resonates with the audience because its storyline shares many parallels with reality, especially the connections between the Civil War and the Great Depression. Yet, these challenges never defeat Scarlett; they empower her and make her stronger, showing that with enough willpower, one can rebuild. This optimism motivates many and suggests hope. Not only was the film inspiring for people during the Depression era, but it also resonates with contemporary audiences, prompting reflection on the privileges we have today. People do change, and struggles are necessary for growth—I believe so. Scarlett’s complex character arc, from a pampered Southern Belle to a self-reliant woman, is a true hero's journey. Political stances aside, she is a role model for everyone and a beacon of resilience. The film is ambitious and thought-provoking.

Movie name: Gone With the Wind
Review: Vivien Leigh, is the greatest stage/movie actor that ever lived. Two lead Oscar wins in while only making 20ish movies is far greater win percentage than Hepburn, Streep. There’s no greater part in movie history in terms of duration scenes. The different emotions needed just the pure duration of the movie alone for lead actor to carry as incredible. Plus she was in her mid-20s and only had made a few movies at this point. Some people are just born to be actors and they understand their craft and they bring that rare quality of movie star charisma, which would be Vivien Leigh. The movie across-the-board is excellent and all elements of movie making one of the greatest movies ever made with one of the greatest cast in any rolls in the movie ever made.

Movie name: Gone With the Wind
Review: Perfection. The greatest movie ever told on the big screen. A world-class performance by the cast, including Vivien Leigh leading the way as Scarlett O'Hara. The latter is the most formidable acting part in American cinema, in terms of length, scope, and scenes. The remarkable thing is that a group tried to stop Leigh from being the character. Leigh was British, and Scarlett was from the book by Margaret Mitchell wrote, an American. The thought of those wishing to stop Leigh was that one had to be American to act in an American role. Fortunately, the producer(s) were just as committed to Leigh playing the part as Leigh was. History would not have been the same if these people had not stuck to their guns. Leigh showed, and justice was obtained, that where we come from does not define the type of acting role we can deliver; a person's job is to act the part and doesn't need to be the character outside of the role. The later would be more typecasting.  The trouble in movies is often typecasting, which is usually a person playing a character over and over, perhaps due to similarities. Leigh played two southern characters in her entire acting career and won Oscars for both, yet she was not southern or even American—just a great actor who understood the mediums of stage. and cinema. Leigh avoided typecasting and movie star syndrome, as she was an actor. Review Leigh's grand body of work, a range, powerful roles that does not happen often in acting: understanding movies and stage. There is a lot to say about the perfection of all the details in this movie which would take a review as long as book Gone the Wind itself! I am sure there are books out there that attempt to do so! The supporting cast, all after Leigh, show us why experts in their field exist, as they mastered the parts, regardless of the length of the scene, words (if any), and delivery. The actors understand the essence of the parts they played! Olivia Mary de Havilland unlike all the other starlets(some also actors) crazed for Scarlett O'Hara part, no de Havilland rather she knew as an actor the right role for her, regardless of position in the movie: lead, supporting. Such a great actor move, put ego aside to deliver part can do the best. There would have been no Scarlett without all the supporting cast as their characters influenced O'Hara. The directing, production, sets, costumes, music, editing, makeup, timing, and flow of Gone With the Wind are as perfect as a movie can be. Times do change, acting, movies, do change. Yet classics, art that transcends time will always exist. Gone With The Wind has been watch by everyone generation and is a timeless movie. Watch this movie! FYI Vivien Leigh, is the greatest stage/movie actor that ever lived. Two lead Oscar wins in while only making 20ish movies is far greater win percentage than Hepburn, Streep. There’s no greater part in movie history in terms of duration scenes. The different emotions needed just the pure duration of the movie alone for lead actor to carry as incredible.

Review: After having read the book. This movie is a complete disservice. The essence of what makes Rebecca a literary work is fully lost by altering or completely changing scenes and misrepresenting the characters personalities and behaviors.

Review: Sensational retelling of the classic novel. Lily James is the star here, and the movie is a phenomenal thriller of chilling proportions. Forget Armie Hammer, Lily James and Kristen Scott-Thomas shine here. Giving a fresh take on the story of the new Mrs De Winter, who has to contend with (in a nutshell) the villainous housekeeper and the ghost of her predecessor, Lily James breathes life into the role and the tone, the ambience, the eerieness of Manderely is on full display. A fantastic set-piece, it does not disappoint from start to finish.

Movie name: Rebecca
Review: I watched this shortly after it came out and recently I've watched it again. I find it weird that it only got 38% from viewers. Is this only in comparison to the older version or the novel? I loved it. So suspenseful that the second time I watched it, even though I knew the outcome, I still had to take breaks to let the tension dissipate. maybe it's because I avoid action movies so I'm not used to fast pacing. If you've read the novel, you know that it's much slower than this film. I tried recently to read it but the opening is such a long detailed description of the gardens at Manderlay that I couldn't get past it.4.5 stars

Review: The book is dark, mysterious and twisted, very good but the movie does not give any ominous atmosphere at all. The characters' personalities are not correctly developed, some of the good characters aren't even there. It doesn't show the extent of Daphne's mind and it focuses to much on the romance.

Movie name: Rebecca
Review: The reviews towards the movie were pretty harsh. I believe since many fans are comparing the movie to the novel or previous movies made by the same tittle. Having no knowledge of the book or any movie, makes this romantic and mysterious movie really interesting and thrilling, totally recommend watching.

Movie name: Rebecca
Review: The movie wasn’t bad. It wasn’t memorable and I feel they spent a lot of time in the beginning bringing out her character, but spent little time really describing Rebecca or the husband. And then it just pretty much ended. The acting was good, but the ending was really bad.

Movie name: Rebecca
Review: Wheatley's Rebecca is solely a dramatisation, and does no justice to the original novel. It is full of spectacle and air where the plot should be. Rebecca, at its core is a psychological thriller exploring the deeply sinister motives of a murderer (Maxim De Winter/Armie Hammer). The strange, one could almost say reverse Oedipal complex which dominates the De Winter's isolating relationship is the focus for the entire narrative - his patronising and arrogant comments ‘I'm asking you to marry me you little fool', and infantilisation of his new wife, ‘You've lost that strange young lost look I loved' suggests pedophilia, and yet in Wheatley's interpretation of this classic horror, he has sadly conformed to the trivial and painstakingly untruthful idea - that Rebecca is solely a Gothic romance. The cinematography and golden age glamour perhaps distracts from the obvious lack of characterisation from Lily James, whose charming buoyancy is the opposite of the shy, timid and easily persuaded young Mrs De Winter. Aside from the incredible characterisation of Mrs Danvers, (Kristin Scott Thomas), the narrative indulges in the romance of a man twice the girl's age (which is, again, omitted) with soft sex scenes on the beach and unnecessary ‘romantic' smooches. The use of the red dress to symbolise promiscuity for the ghost of Rebecca is sadly obvious and superficial, whilst the lack of key symbols, such as the rhododendrons (female sexuality) are omitted. Sadly, it can be concluded that Wheatley has falllen, or rather indulged in the popular theory that Rebecca is a romance, and attempts to please his audience through glam and glitter. If you want to watch a visually beautiful film and have not read Rebecca, you will be delighted if slightly disturbed by the visual hints at the unequal and dangerous power dynamic between the couple. If you know Rebecca, you will be outraged at the like-ability of this narcissistic murder, and confused by the dramatisation.

Review: If you have seen the original version of Rebecca that was done in the 1940's, you might appreciate this movie more. Rebecca is Daphne du Maurier's crowning achievement as a novelist. It is a romantic mystery with a touch of noir and the paranormal. The story is peculiar because it leaves you perpetually distressed, yet hopeful for a happy ending. It can translate well to the big screen. I like the older movie better, but this is still good and I would never discourage anyone from watching it. I gave it 4 1/2 stars. Given a choice I would watch the old version over this one because that's what I grew up with.

Review: the book was annoying but better

Movie name: Rebecca
Review: This film missed the mark. I can never understand why filmmakers decide to make a film based on a book if they know they are going to completely change the principal characters and vital plot points. It's an insult to the classic Rebeca by Daphne Du Maurier for this film to have the same name as the book. I have to wonder if the screenwriters' and director even fully read the book or if they decided to take the concept and loosely make a movie based upon it; the movie is inspired by, not based on the book; so much of the story and the people has been stripped away, it's something different entirely. Here's a tip: if you're writing a screenplay based on a book but can't even keep the essence of the main characters, simple details, the theme, or important plot points, and have to add in scenes that would never occur- then maybe don't write or make the film.

Movie name: Rebecca
Review: In no meaningful ways surpassing its predecessor, this version of Rebecca shines only in that it is visual stunning, and well acted. The plot beats are stilted at times, and the narrative lacks focus. I wanted this to be great, instead I was passably entertained. I love Lily James, and she embodied her character perfectly, I found it hard to get behind many of the characters decisions. That pulled me away from the narrative as it was centered on her.

Review: I started watching with the expectation that this remake would never touch the 1940 Hitchcock classic. For the first two thirds of the movie I must admit I found it rather entertaining, hewing close to the 1940 film. But in the final third the film went off the rails. I never read the book, so I checked Wikipedia to see which film more closely resembled the Du Maurier novel. It turns out that this movie is much closer to the original source material. However, that doesn't mean it is a better movie. The same thing happened with Mildred Pierce. The 2011 miniseries with Kate Winslett was closer to the novel, but Joan Crawford's 1945 film was much better. Anyway, this Rebecca really isn't really all that bad, I just think it's more worthwhile to invest two hours in the earlier film.

Review: Lousy direction, lousy editing, lousy story telling... and the WORST costumes I've ever seen on a leading man and leading lady - ill-fitting and unflattering. The wealthy Mr de Winter has one pair of un-tailored, baggy, *tan* pants to wear the entire time he's in Monte Carlo. What's that about? Even his pajama bottoms aren't cut right. Everything the character would have worn would have been tailored to perfection for him. If they were bought off the rack they would have looked better. Speaking of pants, the second Mrs de Winter's baggy white slacks look horrible on her, evidently cut from the same pattern as Mr de Winter's pants. A wonderful, talented cast is wasted in this choppy, flat, mess of a movie.

Movie name: The Thief of Bagdad
Review: The Thief of Bagdad challenges the negative opinion many people have of movie producers. Traditionally the movie producer is thought to be the crude and commercial driving force who interferes with the creative talent of the director and writer. Here we have a film that actually went through six different directors, including producer Alexander Korda himself and his brother, Zoltan. The project went through so many changes and delays that its young lead actor Sabu had actually grown several inches by the time that the film was nearing completion, and some early scenes had to be shot again. Such a process sounds like a mess, but it seems that Korda kept his nerve. The final movie is coherent and brilliant, and enormous fun to watch. The story is set in the world of the Thousand and One Nights, complete with genies and flying carpets, but it is not based on any specific story in that book. The hero is the grandson of Harun-al-Rashid, a regular character in the book. There is some perfunctory praise of Allah. The film opens in the middle of the story with a beggar telling listeners what happened to him, calling to mind the storytelling of Scheherazade in the Thousand and One Nights. The beggar telling the story is blind, and he has a dog that is able to identify false coins. Notably the first image we see in the movie is a drawing of an eye daubed on a boat. Eyes play a significant part in the film, and we get occasional close-ups of the eyes of the leading villain, a sorcerer, later on. Meanwhile a princess is in a deep sleep, and cannot be awakened. These details tantalise the viewer into watching the movie to learn more about how this situation arose, so the blind narrator goes back to the beginning of his tale, and the story begins in earnest. The vizier is played with malicious glee by Conrad Veidt. Dressed permanently in black, Jaffar is the embodiment of pure evil, with his rasping voice and vicious face. Jaffar is also a magician, but his skills are those of the dark arts. Later when he casts a spell on the movie's titular character, we see the shadow of his hands reaching out to his victim. Apu is played with enthusiasm by Sabu, a regular actor in movies of this time. An Indian by birth, Sabu was often brought in to act the role of Indian or Middle Eastern young boys. He was generally bare-chested, a rarity in movies at that time, and only permissible because he was playing a non-white character. Sadly his career thrived briefly on the racism of his age. Notably his surname is never included in his acting roles – it is Dastagir. One of the best features of The Thief of Bagdad is that its special effects were very good for the time in which it was made, and are still a pleasure to look at today. This was the first movie to use blue screen effects. The film was given an illusion of depth by hanging a matte painting over the camera, and deliberately creating a blurry effect. A genie was created using an optical printer. However the special effects were made more real by using actual people, animals or objects where possible. The genie is a real actor, the flying carpet is a real carpet, and the flying horse is a real horse. The movie uses large sets which never look like anything except a movie set, but the artificiality adds to the magical and fantastical ambience. A whole range of sets and props are used to ensure that the viewer is treated to a great spectacle – we see a large genie, a clockwork flying horse, a lethal clockwork woman with many arms, and a giant spider, to name but a few. In line with Korda's grand vision for the film, there are a large number of extras, and a rousing music score.

Movie name: The Thief of Bagdad
Review: Imagine receiving three wishes from a genie and using your first one on a pan of sausages. Not nearly as commonly mentioned as many other adventure films of the period, The Thief of Bagdad was a startling success in its day and a landmark in film design, with its early use of Technicolor and implementation of image compositing through bluescreening, courtesy of special effects coordinator Lawrence Butler. Nominally a remake of the earlier Douglas Fairbanks film that also takes inspiration from the One Thousand and One Nights, this adaptation from Michael Powell and Alexander Korda clearly had a direct influence on Disney's Aladdin, which carries over many of the distinct character design features, but shows its age in places; the film places much greater emphasis on its then-stupefying visual effects, and flounders haphazardly when it comes to character and tone, featuring an adventurous spirit but lacking the swagger of swashbucklers produced at around the same time. John Justin's Ahmad, nominally a main character, is lifeless and dull, it's only when you get to the supporting characters that the film begins to convery some energy, particularly with Rex Ingram's Djinn and Miles Malleson's Sultan of Basra (who also doubles as screenwriter). While innovative for its composite visual effects, the film's most endearing component is its practical design, featuring monumental sets brimming with color; right as the film starts the audience is treated to an incredible port scene, with full-sized ships draped in resplendently bright flags. As the film goes on, the film seldom slouches in its sets and costumes, able to hang with the best of the exotic adventure romps of the era, which largely compensates when the story lags behind. Creative miniatures and use of perspective give a sense of scale that few films of the era could match, though narratively speaking some pre-war contemporaries seem to have done more with less. (3/5)

Review: This film features some brilliant set pieces of the time. The music felt a bit over the top at points but its quite colourful visually and plot wise it moves at a gentle pace (which is not necessarily a bad thing, depending on your patience and so on). I liked that it featured a charming naivety with some impressive special effects given it dates from the 40s. I'd say this is definitely worth a watch if it interest you, although the plot is perhaps a little too slow for modern generations, it may not interest everyone but I mainly liked it in terms of seeing the special effects, the costumes and the cinematography.

Movie name: The Thief of Bagdad
Review: The Greatest Live Action Adaptation of Aladdin ever, Alexander Korda's The Thief of Bagdad deserves to be the greatest Arabian adventure that Hollywood has to offer in 1940, and it is still an excellent flick today as of 2022. June Duprez did do a nice job for acting as the Princess.

Movie name: The Thief of Bagdad
Review: A fun and funny film, but it certainly hasn't aged as well as other films from the same era. I imagine the special effects that elicit guffaws today were getting oohs and ahhs in 1940. Conrad Veit and Sabu are very fun, and the plot is really weird in a charming way. The colors are still gorgeous, the colors and the outlandish costumes and (some of the) sets are the best parts of the film for me.

Movie name: The Thief of Bagdad
Review: I think I gave myself a little too much context prior to watching this and as a result I wasn't as impressed as a newcomer may have been. The 1924 Thief of Bagdad's special effects stood out more from its peers than this movie's effects did. This one had the bad luck to have apparently invented the bluescreen effect that's become so ubiquitous that it's rather easy to spot in modern viewing, whereas the effects in the 1924 one (like turning a climbing pole into a rope while he's resting on top of it) are still impressive today. The main thing this version had going for it was the tremendous use of color in its backgrounds & costumes, rivaling Wizard of Oz in how heavily they leaned into the vibrant color palette as a key to the movie's quality. Some individual scenes played like the actors could've used more rehearsing as there were miscues and awkward moments that didn't seem intentional. I wouldn't say that I enjoyed watching the original more than this one because there's a lot of benefit in adding color and sound, but to me the original was more finely crafted.

Movie name: The Thief of Bagdad
Review: The Thief of Bagdad is an ambitious film. The sets are large & elaborate, the locations are exotic & unusual, and the visual effects are quite impressive for the time. Even the plot is told in a unique way. Characters like Abu, Jaffar, the princess, the genie, and the portly mutton-chopped sultan make it obvious that this film made an impact on those who saw it. This movie is a little dated, yes, but it's one I think many people would still enjoy.

Review: Simplistic, yet ambitious. It was a take on the classic tale I had not yet encountered. However, it was far from perfect with its confusing motives and direction. Regardless, it is an achievement.

Movie name: The Thief of Bagdad
Review: This movie has its magical moments but after 2/3 it became boring probably due inconsistent storytelling. Full of special effects that most of them were revolutionary during that time but hasn't aged so well. But most annoying part was the love story between Princess and Ahmad. This felt very artificial probably due to the lack of chemistry between June Duprez and John Justin.

Review: A wonderous journey to a maze of danger,love and courage,all shown in beautiful special effects,but the most magical of all is the characters that once lived in this technicolor world! Conrad Veidt is easily the greatest of these characters;his voice,looks and movement stand out.

Movie name: The Thief of Bagdad
Review: Released a year after Wizard of Oz, Thief of Bagdad is clearly in that same vein, though not as transcendently great. Still, it's a sweeping, silly and charming old movie with all the trappings of its time and genre: melodramatic music, theatrical acting, random musical numbers, innovative effects, and a fantastically malevolent villain. And best of all, there's no sign of a blue Will Smith.

Review: A marvel of cutting-edge technical advancement in its time, of course a lot of the special effects look dated and performances seem stilted from a modern perspective—yet the film's obvious influence on the adventure genre and the energy of its achievement remain undeniable, if not quite as dazzling as it first appeared 80 years ago.

Review: I might well have been more wowed by this if I hadn't seen the Fairbanks version previously, as this one certainly boasts impressive sets, action scenes, and some dazzling Technicolor cinematography. My problem with Powell's version is that it lacks a proper hero, as the single romantic action hero represented by Fairbanks is split into an amorous but inactive prince and an adventurous but non-romantic boy thief. All the money in the production can't compensate for the hole this strange decision creates at its centre. For anyone who can tolerate the conventions of silent film I strongly recommend checking out the 1924 version, which I found much more emotionally engaging.

Review: Non-linear, stories-within-stories that feature flying horses, magic carpets, djinni and other magic in a visually stunning film which follows a deposed king and a wily little thief he befriended in a dungeon as they travel half-way 'round the world in hopes of reclaiming the throne and wooing a hottie princess. Set in the "The Book of One Thousand and One Nights", fans of The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Prince of Persia video game series would enjoy.

Review: Never saw the 1924 original, but this is as far as I know at least as well-known and good. This is a fantastic trip as we meet up with King Ahmad as he hooks up with small time crook an thief Abu to reclaim his throne. This (or the original) is surely a huge inspiration for the Aladdin-series. Djinnies, Abu, sultans, flying carpets, princesses - you name it. Supercool music in this very imaginative film with a dialogue that carries a lot of wisdom. It's also quite fast paced - there is a lot of happenings in this story, but nothing seem unneccessary or dragged out. Neat effects - must have had a huge budget. It also won an Oscar for it's effects, among with two others in close categories. A superior fairytale and a true classic that has aged surprizingly well. 9 out of 10 wishes.

Movie name: The Thief of Bagdad
Review: For those who were interested to see where Disney got much of their inspiration for "Aladdin," watch this 1940 masterpiece. Starring Sabu as young thieving kid Abu, this is one eye-popping Middle Eastern adventure tale involves sorcery, magic, and romance, all in healthy amounts. As a nod to the Arabian Nights tales, "Thief of Baghdad" has everything one would want from an adventure story, without being muddled by never-ending action scenes and confusing plot lines. (My one and only gripe with the film is the semi-cheesy looking giant spider towards the end, which brings this movie one step too close to monster movie territory popularized a decade after.) The towering genie giant, who is both menacing and powerful, is brilliantly portrayed by Rex Ingram, (who played Jim one year prior in "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" alongside Mickey Rooney.) "Thief of Baghdad" is also the first film in history, (thanks to RKO Radio Pictures,) to utilize blue screen effects; to portray flying horses, soaring genies, and larger-than-life sets, such a technical achievement was a necessity, and the movie industry owes much to this often-overlooked film. (Take that, "Wizard of Oz!" )

Review: The reminiscing of Roddy McDowall's character in this film, to his childhood, set in the South Wales mining valleys is poignant. All the characters are beautifully acted though some of the Welsh accents are a tad dodgy. It is a film, but does depict the hard lives they lived and the way they were treated by the mining companies then and how Chapel was central to their lives. The singing of Calon Lan and Myfanwy, just made me cry. The film is full of every emotion.

Review: A tear jerker at times, this family drama has multi-dimensional characters and quality acting. The sets were skillfully made and the score is moving. I have seen it many times, and always find the film impressive. This 1941 movie beat out Maltese Falcon, Citizen Cain and Sergeant York for the Best Picture Academy Award and John Ford was honored as Best Director. If you have never seen this film, it is definitely worth watching.

Review: Watched this film first as a child and it moved me to tears. Accents were a little bit questionable, (apart from Dai Bando of course as Rhys Williams was born in Clydach) but all in all they weren't too bad. Huw was the star of the show for me, as you see his innocence chip away bit by bit from all the trauma he encounters during his childhood. It was common back in that time for all the men (and children) to work in the mines back then, but it's still traumatic to watch. Would have liked to have seen more on the story between Angharad and Mr Gruffydd. It seemed like it was leaving a few things out that might have cleared up their plot a little. Also, I was amazed to hear that Gweiddi'r Arglwydd (the Lord's prayer) to be spoken in Welsh, as well as Welsh hymns being sung. That was a lovely thing that I'm very happy that they included, as pretty much everyone in Wales at that time spoke Welsh as a first language. The male choirs singing was absolutely beautiful too. And to add, I've seen some comments on here about how the names were spelt differently, (eg "Hugh" spelt as Huw) it's because it's set in Wales, the characters would obviously be in Welsh.

Review: There's so much going on in this movie that you can't really pay the needed attention it deserves. 3 hours wouldn't be enough to tell this story. Still good acting and beautiful settings makes this an interesting choice. At least the themes around it make it worth.

Movie name: How Green Was My Valley
Review: Admittedly I watched this with the idea that this movie was such a classic and had great performers in it. It wasn't quite as good as I had expected. People have panned this for the performers not having proper Welsh accents or the scenario looking too much like California. But the truth is that even without World War Two going on, the Hollywood film industry was actually in bad financial shape during the Great Depression like everybody else, and it would have been too expensive and difficult to make everything properly look and sound like Wales, let alone go on location. The idea was to show essentially a poor mining town, even if the settings didn't match the interiors of actual Welsh houses. I have not seen the book, so I cannot say how well the movie follows it. Admittedly the major problem was that the script was rather disjointed. It starts off with the protagonist talking about leaving his village and describing how it was when he was growing up. The first part has the miners going on strike when their wages are cut, and the father denounces the idea of his sons joining a labor union (though not explaining why). Later on, the mine owner's son wants to marry the family's daughter, and she is in love with the local preacher but marries the son anyway. Huw, the son who tells the story, is sent to the local school, gets bullied by classmates and teacher, fights back, and eventually graduates with honors, but chooses to work in the mine. That is never explained either. The movie's fundamental problem is that things happen one after another, but without explanations about people's attitudes and why they are what they are, or why people make certain choices which seem illogical. In the end, we don't even know why the protagonist finally leaves the valley when he does, or what he plans to do.

Movie name: How Green Was My Valley
Review: A 1941 classic, and it seemed like one. But still difficult to relate to today. Welsh miners of a century ago, etc. Even had quite a bit of religion and church. Supposedly a great novel. I've heard of it for seems forever, and never saw it until caught quite a bit of it on THE MOVIE CHANNEL, 7.13.2021. And some very strange spelling for names. Never saw a Hugh spelled Huw, but it does make more sense.

Review: Anyone with a trained eye for perfect visual poetry will be left near breathless by numerous scenes within this classic John Ford drama. Director of photography Arthur Miller (Gentleman's Agreement ‘47) works so astonishingly well with Ford that you will be left wondering who called what shot. I can just picture them sitting in the rushes viewing room, shedding tears of pure joy while seeing the fruits of their labour for the first time. The superb casting and script go hand in hand and are equally impressive as this polished story unfolds. For some of the more cynical modern critics and viewers, not used to this filmmaker's style, it could be seen as a sentimentalised vision of life in a Welsh mining village of the era - but it's so well produced that honest or sensitive viewers won't be without a warm glow in their hearts during many stirring scenes. The picture unfolds its story in a classic manner, without faltering or adding any unnecessary padding. If looking for stylish vintage moviemaking with epic momentum that doesn't out-stay its welcome, you won't go too wrong with a walk through this valley. Great production design and storytelling, with a marvellous narration by the great (black banned) actor, director, Irving Pichel (but substituted in original British release prints) It could perhaps be a little manipulative but undeniably one of the all-time film greats. The Twentieth Century Fox DVD re-mastering offers terrific images but the disc I had is slightly out of lip-sync (with the brown/green cover) so look for a later re-issue version.

Review: Let's tour the British Isles once again with How Green Was My Valley. This movie, based on a novel, centers around the Morgans, a coal mining family who dwells in a village in South Wales. As the story progresses, the workers become poorer within years, Huw (Roddy McDowall) struggles through school, and the patriarch Gwilym (Donald Crisp) dies. Even though Walter Pidgeon and Maureen O'Hara receive top billing, the real star is Roddy McDowall, who's innocence deteriorates and maturity grows due to all the trauma happening to his family. As his older self woefully narrates, "I'm going from my valley. And this time, I shall never return." Also, director John Ford's forte has always been his landscape vistas as a cigil for mood. In fact, he wanted to shoot the movie on location in Wales. However, due to the conflicts in World War II, it was shot in the Santa Monica Mountains. Still, it captures the dreary coal-black middle class environment similar to miserable conditions of families during The Great Depression. While not a masterpiece, How Green Was My Valley still one of Ford's finest. (4 Store-bought Toffees out of 5)

Review: Laughable melodrama with not a moment of levity.

Movie name: Blood and Sand
Review: A Technicolor classic, flush with vivid hues, tempered with shadow, with the great Tyrone Power portraying matador Juan Gallardo - a man determined to reach the top of the bullfighting world, at any cost. Rita Hayworth sizzles as the socialite temptress, with plenty of memorable, atmospheric Spanish music throughout. Also starring Anthony Quinn (who's featured in a steamy dance with Hayworth) as well as John Carradine. Recommended, if for nothing else than the rich palette of color deftly presented by director Mamoulian.

Movie name: Blood and Sand
Review: This bullfighting epic is a remake of a 1922 film starring Rudolph Valentino. An early Technicolour movie, it showcased a new generation of stars, including Tyrone Power, Rita Hayworth, Linda Darnell and Anthony Quinn. But the best performance comes from Alla Nazimova, a survivor of the silent era, as Power's mother.

Movie name: Blood and Sand
Review: 20th Century Fox's 1941 production BLOOD & SAND is a remake of the 1922 silent classic that established Rudolph Valentino as the greatest star of early cinema. Beautifully photographed in vivid 3 strip Technicolor by Ernest Palmer and Ray Renahan the elaborate newer version had the obvious heir-apparent to the silent screen star in dashing Tyrone Power. Written for the screen by Jo Swerling from the novel by Vicente Blasco Ibanez it was directed with a certain amount of flair, it has to be said, by Rouben Mamoulian who just the previous year had had his greatest success with Tyrone Power when he directed him in the classic "Mark of Zorro". The film recounts the story of a young, ambitious and quite naive bullfighter Juan Gallardo (Power) who falls under the spell of a beauteous and attractive socialite (Rita Hayworth) wrecking his relationship with Carmen (Linda Darnell) the girl who has always loved him since childhood. The picture culminates with Juan discovering too late that he is only a toy for the manipulative socialite. And finally in the end when he is gored by a bull in the ring it is the forgiving Carmen, his only true love, that comes to his side to comfort him as he lays dying. BLOOD & SAND was a very popular picture of the War years and remains a great favourite with Power devotees. However I have to confess to never being very fond of it. There is little doubt Ty Power is good as the aspiring Matador and Hayworth chews up every bit of scenery in sight as the alluring Donna Sol. But with the exception of Anthony Quinn and that memorable dance sequence he does with Hayworth I found the rest of the cast - particularly the young actor Rex Downing who played Juan as a boy - unconvincing and altogether uninspiring. In fact the whole picture for me was curiously uninvolving! Also Juan being gored by the bull towards the end is very badly done! You don't really see what happens to him. Was he gored in the back or the front? It is very difficult to decipher. And he appears very clean and unmarked in his ensuing death scene. Nevertheless the great Alfred Newman saves the day with his terrific score. Besides his music capturing all the heat, dust and passion of the bullring the composer also incorporates into his score the sumptuous traditional Spanish guitar melody "Romance D'Amour". An engaging and totally ravishing piece that was used to greater effect in "Forbidden Games" in 1952 when it was played by guitar genius Narciso Yepes. BLOOD & SAND can at least be enjoyed for its awesome colour Cinematography, Newman's great music, the star power and presence of Tyrone Power and the flowing beauty of Rita Hayworth.

Review: A bit melodramatic bullfighting tale here. Tyrone Power plays a mexican bullfighter wooed from his wife, like all men seem to do, by Rita Heyworth. His art suffers from it, and soon his world come crumbling down. Corny and stilted dialogue, shaky camerawork and overblown scenarios hold this one down, but it's still watchable because of that.

Review: The cow has not been born yet that can give birth to the bull that can kill me. The son of a deceased bull fighter is being raised in humble surroundings and decides to continue down a parallel path as his father. He leaves his home and heads to Madrid where he perfects his craft, gets married, and lives a life of luxury. However, the pit falls that come with being rich may destroy the prized bull fighter. Could this be a classic example of be careful what you wish for? "We need to stop the train!" "How're you going to stop a train?" "Have you ever seen a bull stop a train?" "You're not a bull." "I can stop a bull so I can stop a train." Rouben Mamoulian, director of Golden Boy, Silk Stockings, The Mark of Zorro, The Gay Desperado, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), and City Streets, delivers Blood and Sand. The storyline for this picture is very interesting and delivers a unique perspective of a bull fighting character. The settings are beautiful and well delivered and the cast delivers wonderful performances. The cast includes Tyrone Powers, Linda Darnell, Rita Hayworth, John Carradine, and Anthony Quinn. "They say when a ship is sinking all of the rats leave. Well, good-bye, rats." My wife and I have become fans of Tyrone Powers who reminds us slightly of Cary Grant. This movie was another great display of his ability to deliver both the tragic and charismatic aspects of his character. This is another great drama film from the 1940s that is worth your time. "I dedicate the death of this bull to the beauty of the woman of Spain." Grade: A-

Movie name: Blood and Sand
Review: One of "Fox's" best! Juan Gallardo (Power) is a young peasant boy who dreams of following his fathers footsteps as a bullfighter, despite his mother's (Nazimova) dismay. Years later when it's finally time, he actually gets his dream, becomes the top star, and marries his beloved, Carmen Espinosa (Darnell). But soon, the alluring socialite Dona Sol Des Muire (Hayworth) ruins both his marriage and career. Will he ever get back to where his was? This Technicolor (beautifully done I might add) soaper is actually a remake from the Rudolph Valentino/Nita Naldi 1922 version. Seeing this, I can see why "Fox" wanted to remake it-- it should have NEVER been made in silent, because the fact that it's a talkie and in color is almost a dream. Other dreams? You get two of the most beautiful women in the '40's, Rita Hayworth and Linda Darnell, in early roles, and you get silent star Nazimova in one of her last roles. But what I noticed most of all, is that this is by far Tyrone Power's best performance. I've only seen 1937's "In Old Chicago", and I didn't think much of him. Luckily, this one beats his previous performance by a landslide, and should have gotten an Oscar nomination at the least. You see his character go on a downward spiral, and somehow he does it effortlessly. Another clue that this is a good movie is you have Greta Garbo's director in "Queen Christina", Rouben Mamoulian. He does a way better job here. This obviously was a very challenging movie to make, with the lavishly done sets, the very expensive Technicolor, and the biggest names in Hollywood were all in this movie. Even with all the pressure, this movie is absolute magic. "Blood and Sand" may not be the best movie ever made, but it certainly stands as one of the most memorable movies for anybody who loves these actors.

Movie name: Blood and Sand
Review: Re-make of the 1922 Valentino silent classic is a great improvement, albeit with my usual misgivings about the casting of handsome yet very American Tyrone Power in the role of doomed bullfighter Juan Gallardo. Great Hollywood treatment, with terrific Technicolor photography by co-cinematographers Ernest Palmer and Ray Rennahan. A dynamite supporting cast includes Linda Darnell, John Carradine, Anthony Quinn and yes, a very suave and continental turn by future Superman George Reeves. But the true standouts are ravishing Rita Hayworth as the enchanting but capricious Dona Sol competing with Laird Cregar's pompous and self-absorbed critic Curro for fleeting fickleness, and former silent siren Alla Nazimova as Gallardo's long-suffering mother.

Review: Do they still have bullfights? I had to look it up...but apparently so. Despite calls by animal-rights groups for the complete banning of bullfighting - there are hold over countries that still recognize it as a traditional sport. I once saw a televised bullfight and it was enough to turn me completely off to the "sport"...so I am biased in that regards. I side with the animal activists. Director Rouben Mamoulian's 1941 film, BLOOD AND SAND is about a bullfighter - yet contains very little bullfighting per se. Times dictated that the filmmakers consider the sensibilities of the audience...so although there are footage of actual bullfighting intercut with the studio shots - the very romanticized notion of the sport just cannot compare to the graphic nature of the real thing...so the viewer is spared the witnessing of an actual "estocada" - when the matador thrusts his sword between the shoulder blades of the bull delivering the coup de grace. During the film's prologue, a youthful Juan Gallardo (Rex Downing) runs away from home accompanied by four of his closest pals. Their hope is to travel to the corrida in Madrid and train to become bullfighters. Juan vows to his girlfriend, Carmen (Ann Todd) that he will be back to marry her once he has become a world-famous matador. Ten years elapse and Juan (now played by Tyrone Power) is a matador - but of dubious skills. Juan's training is at the expense of a formal education so that Juan (and his pals) cannot read and so misunderstands the articles written about him by the local bullfight critic, Natalo Curro (Laird Cregar). Thinking he is on his way to becoming famous, Juan returns to his home town to propose to Carmen (now played by Linda Darnell). Juan achieves a modicum of success...well enough to support his wife and family. His growing fame also catches the eye of a socialite, Dona Sol (Rita Hayworth) - who is known for collecting and discarding men as a hobby. The film presents some interesting themes but doesn't go far enough to achieve real drama. I was hoping for more tension between the characters but everyone is just too nice. Juan, despite his bravado is not a very interesting character. Tyrone Power is handsome, but seems a bit too youthful looking to be the carousing matador. His scenes with Darnell are okay but it didn't help that scenes with Dona Sol are only implied and off camera - so that no chemistry is ever achieved with Rita Hayworth. Linda Darnell is a very pretty actress, but Hayworth is just stunning in every scene she is in. It would be 5 more years until GILDA but she is just the embodiment of feminine pulchritude here (especially wearing that white evening dress). Hayworth plays the femme fatale - she is most definitely "femme" but the script could have used a bit more "fatale" of the Bette Davis kind. Except for the scene in which Dona Sol is confronted by Carmen (my favorite scene in the film) or when she "tosses away" a lover (played by a young George Reeves) is when Hayworth's character shows a bit of venom - but I really wanted to see more. A bit wasted too are Juan's friends Manolo (Anthony Quinn) and Nacional (John Carradine)...although Quinn does a nifty flamenco dance scene with Hayworth. The film is beautifully shot for an early technicolor film. Early technicolor required a lot of light so it's interesting that the cinematographers were able to achieve some shadow effects in their interior sets. Compare that to some of the color films of the 50's and 60's where sets have that evenly lit look (a boring look really). GILDA is black & white - so it's a real treat viewing Rita Hayworth in this film in color.

Review: 3: There is no mistaking a mammalian picture. He is one of the great unsung and mostly forgotten directors, but he made more than a few classics: Love Me Tonight, Queen Christina, Applause, The Mark of Zorro, The Gay Desperado, Silk Stockings, etc. Love Me Tonight alone would cement his place as a legendary director. I'll never forget humming and skipping me way through the night away from the MoMA the first time I saw it. The film has significant depth, unusual and brilliant framing, and superb production values. It made me wish there were more Hemingway pictures made. It also made me want to watch a few Almodovar pictures again, as well as be exposed to a wider variety of Spanish pictures than I have been thus far. It also of course makes me want to watch a few Mamoulian films again. Power and Hayworth make a nice-looking on screen couple. However, no one with that much hair on their head could possibly be that bare on the rest of their body. Hayworth doesn't look or perform her best, but she is certainly more than merely alluring. A little too much makeup though and I wasn't terribly impressed with her lighting. I'd say she looks better in black and white, at least in general, despite her auburn locks and pink dress. I'm certainly looking forward to seeing her on Blu-Ray. Carradine is a more than adequate character actor as well. He's a bit of a chameleon, but I think he works best as a villain. I didn't even realize that was Anthony Quinn until the credits. Funny.

Movie name: Blood and Sand
Review: This movie is TERRIBLE. When Linda Darnell is the least irritating part of a movie with Rita Hayworth, then that is a Bad Sign. Seriously, it's good for MSTing (and for eyeing a hot young Anthony Quinn . . . who I kept wanting to hijack the movie) but NOTHING else.

Movie name: Blood and Sand
Review: Rita Hayworth, playing the same character as always - distracting a man into forsaking a woman who truly loves him... and then leaving him. Power is particularly brooding as the matador, and it's a good showcase of the fickleness of man...

Movie name: Blood and Sand
Review: Realism takes a backseat to romance in this 1941 Technicolor extravaganza. A young Spanish boy rises from the depths of poverty to become "The World's Greatest Bullfighter". Tyrone Power is Juan Gallardo, the matador who discovers that fame is fleeting and not necessarily all that it is cracked up to be. His marriage to the young, virtuous Carmen (Linda Darnell) is threatened when his notoriety attracts the attention of the beautiful but unscrupulous Dona Sol (Rita Hayworth). This classic teaming of Hollywood heavyweights also features an up-and-coming young Anthony Quinn in a memorable supporting role. Every effort was made to try and make the violent sport of bullfighting more palatable for American audiences. Scenes of slaughter and blood are shot from a distance or, more often than not, not at all - opting instead for reaction shots of the crowd to convey the shock and brutality of the circumstance. <i>Blood and Sand</i> may not be an honest rendering of Spanish toreadors but it is enormously entertaining.

Movie name: Blood and Sand
Review: 6.5/10. Excellent production values, great art direction. The cinematography is exceptional. It's a good story but a bit overlong. The acting is fine, Tyrone Power is a bit weak however.

Review: Fox overdoes things as usual.

Movie name: Blood and Sand
Review: Netflix alert: Superb refurbishing of Technicolor studio job with top talent doing exactly as they were told. No actual blood, however sand is authentic. Helps to have aficion for flamenco and bullfighting (bullfighhting for "all the family," that is), but supporting perfs by Carradine and Quinn guarantee good time for all. If you speak Spanish, you will also be dead by laughing.

Movie name: Mrs. Miniver
Review: This movie about a family facing the trials and tribulations of the early years of WWII in England shows the joys of family life, a favourite topic of MGM. It starts out with trifles like a wife being embarrassed to let her husband know how much money she spent on a hat and then segues into children going off to war and Nazi airmen parachuting into the back garden. While it's a bit lengthy at times for modern tastes, I think, it's full of gems like the bunker scene where the two parents, their two children, and the family cat, Napoleon, take shelter while a huge, violent bombing raid unfolds above them. Explosions and gunfire on the soundtrack gradually lead to jolts and shaking in their sandbagged shelter. It's a masterful combination of sound design, acting, and pacing and completely suspenseful and terrifying. It's also a metaphor for the whole movie and the way it subtly and gradually shifts from trifles and superficialities to life and death situations almost without the spectator noticing. It's the kind of film that makes an impact on you without doing so overly overtly.

Review: What 21st century critics and fans don't realize that WW2 morale-boosting movies were resoundingly cheered by 1942 audiences. One cannot apply the mores and morals of this century to period films: critics do, but they have no connection to the era depicted in these films.

Movie name: Mrs. Miniver
Review: World War II from the middle-class Brits' perspective. We join a hard-working family, share their modest concerns just before the onset of hostilities, then stand by as their priorities drastically shift. In one moment, lavish expenses, exclusive flower shows and snooty neighbors comprise the extent of their worries. In the next, ears are tuned for air raid sirens, an eldest son races to join the RAF and a desperate Nazi paratrooper appears in the garden. Mrs. Miniver was indeed propaganda, boosting the Allied cause while the wounds of the Nazis' blitz on London were still fresh, but it's far more subtle than the loud, whitewashed, nationalistic newsreels that usually represent that term. Here, we identify with the squabbles of pre-war life, feel the conflicted emotions of standing up for one's beliefs at great personal risk, linger on the dark terror of a quaking single-family bomb shelter at bedtime. Those latter moments seem to stretch forever; a powerful blend of whimpering children and brave-faced parents that squeezes every last drop of empathy from a very ripe scenario. The Minivers are little more than pawns in this global game, but because the first act is so effectively disarming, it's easy to feel trapped, unprepared, in that bunker right beside them. We fear the worst for their son, who routinely alerts family to his safety by cutting engines during household fly-overs, but this war is no distant specter. By the famously rousing final soliloquy, recited amidst the ruins of a bombed-out chapel, every single member of the community has paid tolls in one form or another. Critically beloved, Mrs. Miniver took home six Academy Awards (including best picture and best director) and was almost immediately adapted to radio for broader dissemination. Even Joseph Goebbels, the infamous Nazi propaganda minister, held it up as a prime example of the kind of cinema he wanted to create with the German media machine.

Review: A classic movie that with a simple script gets you to convey a strong message, I liked the simplicity of the storytelling.

Review: Ridiculous that reviewers would complain about the film's "propaganda." Implying that there was something false or overdone in the presentation of the conflict and the stakes involved. The enemy was Nazis. Hitler. It wasn't propaganda, it was rallying to a just and noble cause. A war that had to be won. Cities and towns were bombed, civilians did die, hundreds, thousands. GB was almost brought to its knees. Dunkirk was a magnificent feat of courage and sacrifice. The meaning and magnitude of the film has only grown with the years. Though it was weird the obvious chemistry between Greer Garson and actor playing her son.

Movie name: Mrs. Miniver
Review: this movie is ok, but can you believe that Greer Garson bagged the guy who played her son in real life?!?! hollywood is crazy sometimes lol

Movie name: Mrs. Miniver
Review: It's hard not to keep watching Greer Garson's amazing face in this movie as the mother managing her family at home near London during WWII. First we see family worrying about a far-off war and then we move to family in bunkers with the war on their doorstep. Just when you think they film is getting too syrupy, the excellent cast brings you back to caring deeply for what happens to this family and their friends.

Movie name: Mrs. Miniver
Review: Impossible to take this seriously. A puff piece of propaganda that desperately builds the twee myths of Britain, stiff upper lip, country living and courtesy. All a load of pompous nonsense. No wonder Churchill loved this film, it stirs the hearts of the unthinking. Daft winner of a best picture but if it's time, this brainwashing nonsense would have been just the tonic in 1942. Hopefully modern eyes can this dross for what it is. Rubbish.

Review: Wonderful film that brings the point home about why we must fight to preserve our freedom and the horrible sacrifices given by so many. This is very relevant today!

Review: Great human relationship film featuring an all-star cast set in small-town England in 1939 as the Nazi's invade Poland and WWII begins in earnest. See the beautiful Greer Garson and Teresa Wright play key roles attracting and giving love to all in their community which helps their small town carry the burdens placed on the English people as they defended their small island from the worst of Hitler's airborne killers.

Review: I became very involved emotionally in this film.. The acting was superb...The ending scene in the bombed church was moving. I was just 6 when the USA got involved in WWII and 11 when it ended. Having known a few friends and family that were in the midst of the bombings over Europe, thunder storms were very frightening and never forgotten. Even in the movie, I felt my heart racing during those bombing raids.

Review: A true 1940s war classic, this film is powerfully delivered by Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon, and the Oscar-winning Teresa Wright (Best Supporting Actress 1942). A sentimental, dramatic, and warming film.

Movie name: Mrs. Miniver
Review: Mrs. Miniver, one about a mother (Greer Garson) of an English family who struggles to survive in the first months of World War II, is mostly okay. Don't get me wrong, Garson does a great job at realizing the main character, that can be said to Teresa Wright, Walter Pidgeon and Henry Travers. I just think the movie around it is a little overrated. Most of the film's problems focus on the cliched subplot concerning Carol and Vin's marriage. Seriously, I hate the typical stern aristocratic dowager trope because I know she's going to have a change of heart near the end, even though here it had a good payoff. On the plus side, the strongest points involve the main story where the Miniver family makes a living around the War. Since Clem, Carol and Vin are absent most of the time, she has to do everything herself, raising the children, protecting them from the bomb blasts, and reporting a nearly-dead Nazi in her house to the police. If the movie focused on her survival during the deadly event all throughout, it would have been stronger. As is, Mrs. Miniver, the movie, has its heart in the right places, but it's not exactly significant like everyone says. If you love the picture, that's okay, but I, a minority, think it's uneven and so-so. (3 Silver Cup-winning Miniver Roses out of 5)

Review: It is effective at what it does

Movie name: Mrs. Miniver
Review: The Oscar for Best Picture awarded in 1943 went to Mrs. Miniver. In all, the film would earn six Oscars in total, out of 12 nominations. Centered on an upper middle class family in pre-war England, the Minivers are a family about to experience what being drawn into World War II will require of them, and take from them. The movie chugs a bit before gaining its steam, but once fully engaged it is a delightful journey. Greer Garson is the Miniver matriarch and holds the family firm as her husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon) heads off to the beaches of Dunkirk and her son Vin (Richard Ney) enters the Royal Air Force. While they are gone she deals with a wounded Nazi soldier and also the discontent of Lady Beldon. The Lady Beldon (May Whitty) is a local aristocrat who is unhappy with the changes happening within the class system as a result of World War I, and who is even more upset that her granddaughter Carol (Teresa Wright) has fallen in love with Vin Miniver. Walter Pidgeon and Richard Ney both give solid performances (Pidgeon being nominated for Best Actor), but the movie is very much feminine-centric. Greer Garson is clearly the brain and strength of the story with Teresa Wright providing the heart. May Whitty's role is much smaller, but watching her stodgy resolve being tested by both her granddaughter and Mrs. Miniver provides some of the films finest moments. All three women were nominated for acting nods, with Garson and Wright taking home Oscar statues. With any wartime flick, one can anticipate the loss of at least one main character. This film pacifies that anticipation, but in a very unexpected way. The film is regarded by many as a propaganda film of sorts. This was one of the first movies to show the impact of the impending war on an individual family. Its intent was to shake the complacency that many in America had about entering into World War II, and it worked. Several marquis posters touted that the film had been "voted the greatest movie ever made". I'm not sure I would go that far, but it is a really strong one, and worthy of being given the respect and label of "a classic".

Movie name: Mrs. Miniver
Review: Much of the early runtime, dedicated to the Minivers' own melodramas, consumerism, and day-to-day, is necessary to effectively put into perspective the devastation and disarray of England's foray into the Second World War from the point of view of a single family. Yes, much of the film can be described as a propaganda piece by modern standards, but considering the universal agreement of its perspective at the time among the audience members of the English-speaking world (and the factual basis of the environment), it was simply a universally appealing setting. But Mrs. Miniver rises above simple crowd-pleasing fare, with its commentary on the conflict's effect on social structures, family, and its clever integration of time through the grandfather clock, all of which is bolstered by well-realized characters. A solid piece of wartime filmography. (3.5/5)

Movie name: SAS: Rise of the Black Swan
Review: The SAS is such a rich subject you would imagine it difficult to make an ordinary movie about them but I'm afraid this is one. I like the lead actor but this is an appalling script with a lot of wooden acting and some appalling directing. The normally excellent Tom Wilkinson is ruined by one of the great shite American accents and it's improbable plot is matched only by its predictability.

Movie name: SAS: Rise of the Black Swan
Review: If you like American action, military, or any resemblance of realism do not watch. I could even get 10 minutes on n without turning it off. Terrible acting and very unrealistic weapon scenes and “sniper shots” right out of the gate. Do not waste your time.

Review: Ruby Rose didn't do it for me in this one. She was supposed to be a cold blooded heartless killer - but it's stiff. Meh.

Movie name: SAS: Rise of the Black Swan
Review: Cleverly done with battlelines that seem to be intentionally blurred in this uniquely drawn action thriller. Though it could seem like a confusing mess to some. I really can’t tell if it was intended to be this way or just terribly done. This could be because the lead was maybe the worst part of the entire thing, whereas his antagonist counterpart was the best. It did, however, succeed in a unique feat as it pulled off what seemed like a 'double-turn' at some point during the middle of the film.

Review: The movie has some good action scenes and surprises but could have been better written and some of the other actors more convincing. The beginning was a bit confusing but did come together in the end. Sam Heughan held this whole movie together and did an excellent job of it and I believe he should be the next James Bond!

Movie name: SAS: Rise of the Black Swan
Review: The Black Swans, (a private military company) is hired by SAS commander George Clements to clear a small village in the Republic of Georgia to make way for a gas pipeline. Well the Black Swans not only clears the village, they massacre the entire village. But they are unknowingly video taped and A Red Notice is issued by Interpol for the leaders of the group, William Lewis and his adult children Grace and Olly are charged with crimes against humanity. In order to cover up for the government involvement, Clements puts out a kill order on the Black Swans leaders and the SAS seizes their headquarters and kills William. Grace and Olly escape and immediately plan to avenge their father. "This isn't about money, its revenge" - Tom Grace now leads the Black Swans and they hijack a train going to Paris and hold the passengers ransom against the British government. The plan is to blow up the gas pipe network when the train is deep inside the Channel Tunnel. "If you don't pay us I'm going to destroy this tunnel and everyone in it" - Grace "If she exposes what we've done this is a very big problem for me. Get down there and kill her" - Prime Minister Now what they didn't count on is a SAS officer, Tom Buckingham (Sam Heughan) being onboard the train. Tom escapes off the train and contacts and warns his friend who is also a SAS agent but he has been bought out by Clements and sends a rescue team into a trap. So Tom is on his own against Grace and the Black Swans. This is a OK thriller with really good actors and lots of action, but it looks more like a TV movie. Still worth the watch. Cast - Sam Heughan, Ruby Rose, Andy Serkis, Tom Wilkonson

Movie name: SAS: Rise of the Black Swan
Review: I think this movie has everything an action film needed, and the only reason critics tore it to shreds was because their favorite action actors weren't in it. If this had been Tom Cruise, Jason Statham, etc. they'd have given it raving reviews. This movie was good! The plot was good, the actors and actresses were good, and as always... Andy Serkis is superb. Also, loved seeing Sam Heughan take on this role. He has amazing acting skills and shined in this.

Movie name: SAS: Rise of the Black Swan
Review: This movie was difficult to watch. SAS: Red Notice is beautiful to look at, but the plot has so many holes and conveniences that it's hard to ignore. Even more difficult is to criticize without commenting on plot elements. So, if you want to avoid spoilers, know that I recommend the movie to those who like old-fashioned action movies, where a single bad boy gets one with everything and everyone. If you care about the plot, you won't be satisfied. From here, I cannot continue this review without criticizing plot elements. **Spoiler warning: From this point forward, I will discuss important plot elements.** In the first few minutes of SAS: Red Notice, we hear narration about psychopathy. We hear that psychopaths are incapable of love, but they can learn. Psychopathy is a widely discussed topic even today, but I'll let that narration slide. But the narration is important because it is the theme of the film. The film introduces us to Black Swans, mercenaries. They destroy an entire village to prove they are the bad guys but end up being filmed by a child with a cell phone, which could expose the British Government's involvement. First, the movie takes place in the 2020 or 2021, digital media era. In what world do these mercenaries live where they assume no one has a smartphone in their hands. Still, either these mercenaries are too good, or I don't know, but I think it's very unlikely that mercenaries like the ones in the movie exist these days, considering how quickly information travels. But out of pity for the plot, this can slide too. So the movie shows us the good guy: Tom. He is a psychopath, according to the film. No, that's not clear and won't be clear until near the end of the movie, but it was obvious to me from the start. With a narration about psychopathy, the way Tom behaves, and the butler's description of how his grandmother loved his grandfather, it was more than obvious that Tom is a psychopath. This will be explored at the end of the movie, of course. The Black Swans are the worst mercenaries of all. Not only must they live in the last century, but they hide in the enemy's backyard, and assume the government won't frame them to get rid of exposure. In less than half an hour, they are tracked down by the SAS, the unit where Tom works. Despite this being a film about active corruption, this element is little explored in the film. The movie focuses more on how Tom is going to save everyone from the train. Save them from the Channel Tunnel train. After being hunted down, the remaining Black Swans decide on a final plan to hijack a Channel Tunnel bullet train. Their plan is to incite terrorist suicide, but really what they want is money and killing innocents in retaliation. Tom coincidentally is on board the hijacked train along with his girlfriend Sophie, a nurse. Tom sneaks out of sight of the Swans, who have tunnel vision. Tom, under the train, decides to open the plumbing in one of the toilets to get on the train and, wow, his girlfriend is in the same toilet, who knew! So their plan is for Tom to save the little girl who was with Sophie in the bathroom but leave Sophie to the Swans to think that Tom took the little girl by force. What a stupid plan. Considering what Tom and Sophie have seen so far, it's obvious that this will end up with Sophie dead, but wrong: for some reason, Grace, leader of the Swans, psychopath, who has so far killed mercilessly, decides to leave Sophie alive, you know, to continue the plot. Much of the film is about Tom sneaking Swans out while the SAS avoids entering out of fear. Here I even understand SAS; in hostage situations, the police are usually passive for the sake of the hostages. But for the sake of the film, the police agree to prepare an entire escape scenario for the bandits in exchange for the freedom of the hostages. I've never seen this happen in reality. The Swans' real plan is to escape through a natural gas pipeline using carts. It's interesting, but it seems so dangerous to me if you consider that one spark and everything goes up in the air. So Tom kills most of the Swans and we're ready for the final battle against Grace. The fight is OK, but then it comes to the point where Tom, being a psychopath, is put to the test. Grace says that she understands him because she is one too and that Tom would make a great Swan. Maybe it would even be interesting if Tom decided to join Grace, but no. He even seems moved, but his will to kill her is stronger. Tom asks Sophie to marry him, but she says no because he is a psychopath. He cries, and she says she will marry him because, if he cried, it means he really loves her. Sigh. The film ends with Tom dying to kill more, with Sophie supporting him as if it were a new adventure. I can't stand films like this. If you want a classic action movie with a lot of gibberish with a macho hero, this movie is for you. I prefer something smarter.

Movie name: The Song of Bernadette
Review: Jennifer Jones is perfect for this role, although it's a phony story. The title ought to be "The Lie of Bernadette". How in this day and age, can people believe in this nonsense? Where is this "virgin" today? Shouldn't she be performing miracles for children with terminal cancers? She can't, because she's imaginary. A well made production with good acting, but like watching "Cinderella". A fictional story.

Movie name: The Song of Bernadette
Review: The famous French novelist Emile Zola once investigated Lourdes and literally saw a girl admitted to the baths with a horrible deformity that was alleged to have resulted from Lupus. He then watched her emerge, completely cured before his eyes. When asked for his opinion, he stated "If all the lepers in all of France were cured right before my eyes, I still would not believe." So you can see what we are up against. I saw this movie when I was a little boy, and it's poetry, dignity and austere beauty provided me with a seed of belief that has grown and never failed for my entire life. I owe a huge debt of gratitude. An amazing, life changing film.

Movie name: The Song of Bernadette
Review: This classic film depicts the famous mystical events of Bernadette at Lourdes in France. Jennifer Jones plays the young Bernadette convincingly. For example, she innocently tells her inquisitors that the "Lady" informed her that she was "The Immaculate Conception" while not knowing what that means. The supporting cast is excellent as well. I also think that the film shot in black and white adds to the starkness of the events that took place there. The viewer is left with a personal decision to make. Either the events were true or a mass hallucination. As Franz Werfel is quoted as saying, "For those who believe no explanation is necessary, for those who do not believe none is possible.

Movie name: The Song of Bernadette
Review: Jennifer Jones won an Oscar in her screen debut as the young innocent Bernadette who unexplainably begins receiving regular visits from the Virgin Mary. At first the small French town does not believe her, but miracles begin to happen, and everyone starts flocking to the looking for cure. The town tries to shut it down and prove her a fraud. The film works with Jones playing a good wholesome person. We want to believe her since she is shown as an honest person. I also really liked the performance from Vincent Price, as a town leader who doubts her. He holds true to his own convictions, but later wonders about his own eternal soul. The film is overly precious and also too long, but it has a good heart, though it's singular view of what it means to be a Christian falls a bit flat.

Review: Weird and stagey. Worth watching once - actually couldn't stop. But it's a Hollywood pandering movie made for 'believers'. Jennifer Jones is at times good but only knows how to whisper-talk in a pre-valleygirl kind of way. Cardbooard sets, funny costumes -- and yet, some of it works. Not sorry I saw it but wouldn't never come back for a second look.

Review: I have watched two religious films this week and this was definitely the weaker of the two as it announces immediately what it's intentions are with it's opening lines "For those who believe, no explanation is necessary. For those who do not believe, no explanation is possible." This puts it in direct opposition the far more thoughtful, quiet Silence (2016) which is about as long but manages to say and do a lot more with it's time than this film does. I watched it primarily because I knew how beloved Jones' lead performance was but I still had some expectation going in that I was going to see an entertaining, well made film. I did not get that which significantly disappointing me when considering the fact that I was so impressed by Gaslight (1944) and Mildred Pierce (1945). Maybe if I was religious I would find watching this film to be a more rewarding experience but as it stands I thought it was a dull slog. Bernadette Soubirous, Jennifer Jones, is a young French Catholic schoolgirl whose community has fallen on hard times. One day she discovers ‘a lady' when out playing with her friends and is told to return to the river every day for the next fifteen days. She attempts to dutifully follow these orders but is held back by the anti-religious leaders in her community like Vital Dutour, Vincent Price, and resentful nun Sister Vauzou, Gladys Cooper. She is eventually able to achieve her goals through hard work and determination and is rewarded it for while becoming a beacon of hope for the suffering and the poor around the globe. She defeats her enemies through love and quiet resilience and is eventually canonized after dying at a young age from tuberculosis. I can't see why this film had to be so damn long when very little actually happens. We get a fairly predictable story of a young person standing up for what they believe is right and after facing some resistance convincing everyone around them to support their cause. This story has been told time and again to the point that this film reminded me of The Hunger Games (2012), a far superior film. This film didn't really do anything new with this formula and yet we spent hours focusing on every trial and tribulation she faces on her journey to truly suffering and becoming worthy of sainthood. I think the film could have been cut down to 100 minutes and been more effective as a piece of Christian propaganda more than anything else because whatever market there would be for this film today are not going to be willing to sit down for 155 minutes. The performances were also rather dull as my father squealed in excitement at seeing Vincent Price whose legacy I was unaware of before seeing this film. Jones is solid as the lead but we spend too much time marveling at just how lovely and perfect that vulnerable little face of hers is to really believe her character. She plays the martyr well as we believe her in all of her earnestness but I was expected more than that from such an acclaimed performance and I hope to see Jones show some range in her future work. I love Anne Revere and her performance as a loving but skeptical mother was a bright spot in a film that seems otherwise unwilling to show characters with layers. Cooper also stands out as a rather vicious nun who is later desperate to repent for her actions taken in a moment of irrational anger. I think that either of these actresses would have been deserving of the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award but of course Lucille Watson is also wonderful in Watch on the Rhine (1943). If you want to see some classic films from this era watch Lifeboat (1944) or Since You Went Away (1944), obviously very different films, because this film does not deserve to be classified as ‘classic'. It's a cheap piece of Christian propaganda masquerading as a serious piece of art worthy of watching, it's really not and it certainly is not one of the best films of 1943 as it doesn't even equal the overrated Casablanca (1943).

Movie name: The Song of Bernadette
Review: Exceptional dramatisation of the seemingly miraculous and controversial visions of young French peasant Bernadette Sorbouis (memorably played by a delightful Jennifer Jones, who won an Oscar for her portrayal). Henry King's impressive adaptation of Frank Werzel's 1941 novel (based on actual events) is graced with some sterling performances (Lee J Cobb, Vincent Price and Gladys Cooper) and an intelligence that stands out amongst some of the pompous Hollywood biblical epics that were to come.

Review: The Song of Bernadette is an excellent film. It is about Bernadette, an adolescent peasant girl, who has a vision of "a beautiful lady" in the city dump in 1858 France. Jennifer Jones and Vincent Price give fantastic performances. The screenplay is well written. Henry King did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the drama. The Song of Bernadette is a must see.

Review: Having a religious belief in something, is nothing to be ashamed about. Everyone can believe in a faith, and accept it for what it is worth. But what happens when someone sees a religious entity, and cannot truly try to explain it? This is the basis for the 1943 film "The Song of Bernadette", a movie in which a young girl claims to witness seeing a religious figure, and all of the trials and tribulations that she encounters. And while the film was honored with wide praise and acclaim from both critics and audiences when it was first released, looking at the film now is just boring. Sure, there are some good things to say about the movie, but as a whole, the movie is slow and tiresome, and get get on some viewer's nerves. "The Song of Bernadette" is good, but it is far from perfection, and makes one lose interest in one's faith. The story involves a young girl named Bernadette (Jennifer Jones). She is poor in 19th Century France, and has little education to her status. One day, Bernadette finds a cave near the river, and it is there that she comes upon the sights lady standing nearby. The only drawback is, only Bernadette can see her. Now, Bernadette believes that this lady is a highly religious figure, despite others not seeing her, and Bernadette soon continues to visit the cave more frequently. This, in turn, gets the attention of certain political and religious officials, who try to set up Bernadette as a fraud for concocting such a lively story. "The Song of Bernadette" is a good movie, but there are some problems with it. Both the story and the pacing of the movie drag, making the entire production feel incredibly slow. At roughly two and a half hours, the movie's slow pacing makes the film feel monotonous and time consuming. Especially when one takes into consideration that there are moments that just feel forced; most notably scenes involving some of the political figures and the church. Also, the direction from Henry King involves all of the actors and actresses delivering their in this rather serious tone. Yes, this movie is considered a drama, but everything that the actors say is a little too dramatic. Also, while the music by Alfred Newman isn't bad, it kind of overtakes the action, and feels like it is the main star of the film. And speaking of the stars, most of the actors do a good job, but watching them feels like witnessing an extended soap opera. But with that said, there are some good things about "The Song of Bernadette". The aforementioned acting may be stilted at times; yet the performances are quite good. Rom the main to the supporting cast, everyone does a good job in this religious drama. And speaking of, the subject matter presented here, is definitely for a more religious audience. Finally, the technical aspects, like the sound, costumes, etc., really stand out as they all grab some sort of attention to detail. This is especially true with the black and white cinematography complementing the overall tonal aspect of the movie. In conclusion, "The Song of Bernadette" is an overlong religious drama, that's still good in some regards, but make sure you value your time and faith wisely.

Review: This movie could use a remake, because while Jennifer Jones was wonderful as a pure, naive young woman, the language in the movie is incredibly out of time for when it took place. I doubt that in 1850 France, girls used phrases like "yoohoo" and "scaredy cat"... complete American accents.

Review: I prefer the film over live. In this case the film has so much more depth of emotion and character than the play versions ever do (I've seen it off Broadway twice). Gerard Butler does an amazing job as the Phantom.

Movie name: The Phantom of the Opera
Review: The movie Phantom of the Opera transported me to another world. The casting—perfection. Visually stunning. The music, the performances and singing sublime. The seductive charisma of Gerard Butler as the phantom had me silently yearning. You are pulled into the story and the emotions brought forth will sweep you away. When the film was over the entire theater audience stood up and cheered and clapped in awe. A must see.

Review: How can I come up with enough words to describe this amazimg movie? Beyond it being one of my all time favorites,the music and cinamatography take you right into the world of The Phantom. The costumes are nothing short of astounding, the storyline will take you through a wide range of emotions, it will make you want to sing and dance,it will make you cry, it will make you fall in love and feel the envy over that love all within moments. This movie keeps a hold on you through every twist in turn, keeping you present and engaged. This will always be a favorite of mine.

Movie name: The Phantom of the Opera
Review: There are some films which have a scene that makes you rethink your decision to watch. The second that Christine got in the underground boat with the Phantom, I was mentally checked out. I can appreciate the dramatic and artistic nature of this movie, but it was a little too over-the-top to keep my interest. With songs twice as long as I would like (i.e., Down Once More), and unnecessary scenes with dull and redundant themes (i.e., the graveyard), this film was a bit of a drag. Raoul is a beast and The Music of the Night is a banger, but other than that, the movie is bottom tier musical cinema. Additional Note: Phantom of the Megaplex > Phantom of the Opera

Movie name: The Phantom of the Opera
Review: Fabulous music, beautiful costumes. Too bad they didn't dub in a real tenor over Gerald Butler. Hurt my ears and soul.

Movie name: The Phantom of the Opera
Review: The epitome of style over substance. Lavish sets and costume but a butchered script, weak acting by almost all in the main cast, subpar singing with a soundtrack trying to "improve" on the wonderful original musical (and failing spectacularly). This movie is an all-round mistake. In this painful movie rendition of a gorgeous musical theatre classic, Emmy Rossum's Christine stands out as particularly offensive, though. She has the charisma of a wet towel and no discernible personality. A pretty face devoid of expression who floats around thinking being pretty can be a substitute for acting or character motivation. Schumacher is responsible for a failure in storytelling that chips away from the haunting beauty of Andrew Lloyd Webber's original. Bad. It's bad.

Review: I would highly recommend seeing this production if you have never seen a film directed by Joel Schumacher. He's an extremely skilled film writer and director who truly loved what he did for a living. I love how he incorporated special effects (such as the chandelier), thrilling music, and talented actors together to create a remarkable production that will forever hold a place deep in people's hearts. Overall, the production is about 2 hours and 20 minutes which doesn't feel long at all because of the various chilling, mysterious events that take place throughout the film.

Movie name: The Phantom of the Opera
Review: This is one of my favourite movies. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve watched it since its release. I have also seen multiple productions of the stage show over the years. The movie is by far my favourite and while I think the rest of the cast is fantastic, it is Gerard Butler as the Phantom that is the main reason I love this version so much. I cannot fathom the low rating given by the critics. Gerard Butler has an absolutely wonderful voice and while not as “operatic” as many have had in the stage versions, he more than manages and brings a raw sexiness to the role in every song he sings. But apart from the singing, his acting performance is second to none. For the first time in any version of Phantom Of The Opera I have seen, I felt a vulnerability and human, rather than monster, quality to the character that I have never felt before. I was wanting him to win Christine’s heart from the minute Butler came on the screen. He is completely believable and charismatic and if I had Christine’s choice of Raoul or Gerard’s Phantom, I certainly would have made a different choice to hers. Highly recommend this film. Ignore the critics.

Movie name: The Phantom of the Opera
Review: The Phantom of the Opera is a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber directed by Joel Schumacher, based on the novel of the same name by French writer Gaston Leroux. The music was composed by Lloyd Webber, the main part of the lyrics by Charles Hart, and its individual fragments by Richard Stilgoe. The plot revolves around the talented singer of the French opera Christine Daae, who was trained, kidnapped, protected and saved by the "Angel of Music", "The Phantom of the Opera" or simply Eric, a disfigured genius from birth, whose role was played by Gerard Butler. Butler's wonderful acting, complemented by a truly angelic voice, made an incredible impression on me. Emmy Rossum also does not leave anyone indifferent, this actress always penetrates her performance deep into the viewer's heart. I can't stress enough how well Patrick Wilson fit into the role of winkont, although I imagined Raul differently, but it's hard to imagine someone else in this role. I liked the film's richness of small details, beautiful voices, and impeccable acting

Movie name: The Phantom of the Opera
Review: Thought the production design and costumes were absolutely perfection from the Chandalier to the cast. Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson give great performances, Minnie Driver is very funny as the Diva La Carlotta. But the star of the musical for me is still Gerard Butler as The Phantom. Butler's portrayal of the Phantom as a victim instead of a villain makes the character more sympathetic and you actually want to route for them. And there's just something about Butler's performance that makes this deformed character so dashing and charming. Between Raoul and The Phantom, I'd take The Phantom.

Movie name: The Phantom of the Opera
Review: Concluyendo la lista de las adaptaciones de The Phantom Of The Opera, esta versión usa como fuente la popular obra musical que realizo Andrew Lloyd Webber. Aunque la adaptación de Lon Chaney sigue siendo considerada la más fiel a la novela de Gaston Leroux, hay que admitir que esta adaptación dirigida por Joel Schumacher es quizás la mejor adaptación de todas. Las magistrales canciones del musical original ayudan a que esta película transmita la esencia de la novela. Los actores Gerard Butler y Patrick Wilson demuestran incluso tener un gran talento vocal para el canto. La versión de Gerard Butler sobre Erik no transmite ese sentimiento de terror que lograba generar la bestial apariencia de Lon Chaney, pero tiene el espíritu del personaje y ofrece un origen del personaje que es similar a la novela. Muchas adaptaciones se hicieron después de las de Universal, han mostrado distintas versiones de Erik con distintas historias de origen. La versión de Gerard Butler logra acercarse a la versión de la novela. Como esta película fue producida por Universal, claramente el diseño de Erik es muy similar a la versión de Claude Rains. Una cosa que todas las adaptaciones anteriores tenían en común es que eran historias de terror y el elemento musical era algo secundario que versiones como la de Robert Englund no siempre tenían en cuenta. Esta versión deja a un lado los elementos del género de terror y se enfoca más en la parte musical. Otros elementos característicos de la novela que esta película toma bastante en cuenta son el drama y el romance, algo que las demás adaptaciones pocas veces toaban en cuenta para orientarse más al terror y el misterio. Lo que esta película logra respetar bastante de la obra original es el aspecto gótico que la producción logra replicar a la perfección. La producción de esta película es una obra de arte que la vuelve otra gran película del cine gótico más actual. Con muy buenos planos, estupendos escenarios y bella ambientación, The Phantom Of The Opera (2004) es una gran película del cine gótico y musical que demuestra ser una digna sucesora de la obra de Gaston Leroux. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 10/10.

Movie name: The Phantom of the Opera
Review: If I watch a movie five times it's safe to assume it's good. The low critic score is unfathomable. Perhaps they misunderstood some aspects of the movie. Christine's first journey into the depths incorporates visuals like painted hands coming out of the walls, holding candelabras. This isn't being "over the top" as critics say. The phantom clearly drugged Christine with a hallucinogen, because they show later that his domain isn't grand at all - filled with rats and cobwebs. This is also why she swoons rather than screaming and running. She's influenced by the drugs. All the singers are great; the pacing is excellent; the pageantry is magnificent; and the quiet moments are meaningful and often moving. I hope the movie didn't loose money because of critics who can't see the passion and thought that went into the film.

Movie name: The Phantom of the Opera
Review: Hands down Gerard Butler, my favorite Phantom; Emmy Rossum my favorite Christine, and Patrick Wilson my favorite Raul. They were cast perfectly and this is another movie I've seen over and over again and 20 years after the original trailers release I can still hear Gerry Butler singing The music of the night he still sings me to sleep. He is my angel of music.

Movie name: The Phantom of the Opera
Review: Joel Schumacher is a hard person to define as an inherently "good" director, which is made explicitly apparent in this sluggish, poorly designed and shot, and questionably acted adaptation of a musical that did not completely function well in the first place.

Movie name: The Phantom of the Opera
Review: A+ amazing, definitely one of our favorites 🙌 Gerard and Emmy knock it out and the sets/scale are spectacular. This movie is brilliantly executed and allows viewers to watch with utter seriousness or with unmitigated giggles and guffaws equally (a quality rare in US cinema). Critic consensus on this is just plain wrong, someone find these hacks a stay-in-its lane drama to make them more comfy 😉

Review: I've seen the play multiple times and I've watched the movie over a 100 times, 3 times in 2 days!! It's truly a moving movie!!

Review: 4.0 stars; One of the top-rated film noir movies of the 40s. This is the third time I've watched it, and each time I pick up something new. A well-done, well-acted movie in any genre. I especially like the dialogue... an excellent screenplay. Over and above all the accolades above, it was a pretty darn good mystery in its own right.

Review: Gene Tierney was mysterious in every role she ever played , and that aspect is well suited here. The murder mystery plot is interesting and the theme song is one of the all time greats.

Movie name: Laura
Review: An All Time Classic. The acting is really good. This is very dialogue heavy but well done dialogue nonetheless. Everyone can come across a bit robotic but still well done, that is until Tierney shows up. She is phenomenal in this, I just wish she was in it more. The cinematography is phenomenal with excellent camerawork and great shadow usage. the music is extremely well done also with great remixes throughout of the title track that is very catchy. The editing is excellent and the pacing is very good. The only knock is during the times we don't focus on Laura it can be a bit robotic and dry at times especially if there is no music. But the story is really clever and keeps you guessing the whole way and never drags in terms of pointless scenes. This is something everyone should see once for sure.

Review: This is quite a pleasant watch with interesting characters. I like how characters try to read one another, to get the better of them. There are one or two twists and its a good watch.

Movie name: Laura
Review: As a mystery film, "Laura" does pretty well, particularly after the midpoint twist, in the sense that the guilty party is anyone's guess, something that surely keeps the proceedings interesting. Nevertheless, as so often happens, the chase is better than the catch; the mystery might have been intriguing, but it's not great, as evidenced by the mundane payoff. As a romantic drama, "Laura" lacks the patient character-building that would keep it from turning into an ordinary, unrealistic melodrama.

Movie name: Laura
Review: Laura, an adaptation of Vera Caspary's suspense novel, the film Laura had many issues in development including the ultimate replacement of director Rouben Mamoulien and cinematographer Lucien Ballard with Otto Preminger given director credit and Joseph LaShelle for cinematographer. The film plays like a murder mystery film but has many twists and turns and is one of the great achievements in the film-noir genre. Although the film only has a handful of characters, all of which are potential suspects, it utilizes a unique script to keep the viewer guessing and never complacent in their suspicions. I won't ruin the film's story or character details but this is something that must be watched to be truly appreciated and analyzed. The use of lighting and the usual trademarks of film-noir are here as well as the haunting score and the film remains an intriguing and psychologically complex film, even now 70 years later after it's initial release. The recent Blu-ray release restores the film's original 87 minute running time which had been cut to 84 minutes for television. If you like film-noir or simply a great and complex mystery film with equally complex characters and wonderfully dark and moody atmosphere, Laura is one of the finest released!

A personal favorite for me all the way!

Movie name: Laura
Review: Otto Preminger's Laura is an absorbing feast for the senses; one of those rare cinematic treats that makes you wish that you could watch it all over again for the very first time without any preconceived expectations. In the tradition of Double Indemnity, the film's appeal derives from its engaging and complex story of suspense, passion, deception and murder. We are drawn into the mystery of the film from its very first immortal lines, and are virtually guaranteed to remain transfixed until the final passion-filled moments. Clever plot developments coincide with the simmering underlying themes of romantic frustration and the intractability of kindred spirits. To relish this film is to celebrate the beauty of the noir genre at the apex of its allure.

Movie name: Laura
Review: The detective is very wooden and the whodunnit became very tedious after a while, when we find out who it is I pretty much lost interest. For me this was a very average film.

Movie name: Laura
Review: Gene, Gene, Gene. Impossible to take your eyes off of her. Everything about her is captivating. The hard-boiled cop who falls in love with her picture, and then in real life, is understandable. Her falling for the cop is a stretch. Clifton Webb is a character easy to detest. Snobbish, boorish, over-ripe, looking like he's ready to fall over, he adds counter-balance to the cast. This is sacrilegious for film noir buffs, but I'd enjoy seeing this in color, if only to see Tierney's hair and eye color and complexion. Okay, I'm a fan of hers.

Review: The only problem I have with this really good film is the casting of stars against type. For me it just didn't work. What we have is very good actors taking on these characters and doing them the best they could. Probably better than many other stars could have. Hey they do a good job but I still saw Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Philip Hoffman playing the roles. That being said I was amazed by the excellent true story unfolding about the real events that happened. I always believe true history is better than fiction. In the capable hands of one of the greatest directors of our time, Mike Nichols I found myself totally absorbed in the fascinating picture. Having lived through the Russian invasion of Afghanistan the movie answered questions I didn't even know I needed to ask

Movie name: Charlie Wilson's War
Review: A well written (Sorkin, duh) and fast talking political comedy that serves as a pretty informative look into the late stages of the Soviet Afghan war and does a good job staying humble despite its salutes to the American hero complex. It's a good movie, but it sure is a little less interesting than its slick writing suggests.

Movie name: Charlie Wilson's War
Review: A 'true story', but a rather boring one that won't stick and arguably didn't deserve a film. Reality was altered for the screen, which led to something often unbelievable, both in terms of the plot and character portrayals. It felt bland and done before, like essentially all political films I've seen, with only the quality cast and a few performances standing out. There was no tension or real emotional impact, and the comedy was limited. The pacing was acceptable, perhaps too much actual footage was relied on, the cinematography was fine, the visual effects were acceptable although the tent bit looked off I remember, the sets/props/costumes were of sufficient calibre, and the soundtrack was average.

Review: Directed by Mike Nichols and written by Aaron Sorkin, the pizzazzy directing and trademark snappy dialogue propel their political comedy recounting the involvement of the titular U.S. Congressman, a CIA operative and an American socialite in abetting Afghan mujahideen in Soviet–Afghan War to an ovation on American heroism that also, alas, backstops the rise of the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and the fateful 9/11 attacks.

Review: The three leading trio of Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Phillip Seymour Hoffman along with Mike Nichols old fashioned directing and Aaron Sorkin’s witty script make Charlie Wilson’s War an entertaining and informative watch for audiences.

Movie name: Charlie Wilson's War
Review: Charlie Wilson's War succeeds on the strength of Aaron Sorkin's stinging script, a high-powered cast of Hollywood stars (including Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Amy Adams and Philip Seymour Hoffman, among others) and an intriguing story based on actual events. Set in 1980, it follows an American Congressman and his efforts to provide weapons to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan to assist them in defeating the Soviets, ultimately contributing to the collapse of the Soviet empire. While the cast gives uniformly stellar performances, Hoffman is an absolute standout as the CIA operative who assists Wilson (Hanks) with his mission. The film should be commended for not turning a blind eye to the fact that the American foreign policy, while successful in leading to the collapse of the USSR, has directly led to the horrific situation currently being experienced in Afghanistan.

Review: Although this was reasonably well received on it's release, it seems to have fallen by the wayside in the last decade or so when the chat about political thrillers comes up. Tom Hanks plays real life figure Charlie Wilson superbly (no surprise) in the true story of how Texas politician Charlie Wilson raised millions of dollars to fund the Mujahidin's secret war against the Soviets in 1980s Afghanistan. It's a little known story, and it's brilliantly adapted for the screen by West Wing legend, Aaron Sorkin.

Movie name: The Picture of Dorian Gray
Review: The Picture Of Dorian Gray es una de la obra más popular del escritor Oscar Wilde y aunque anteriormente ya se llevó a la gran pantalla siete veces en la época del cine silente, esta película es la adaptación más conocida que se introduce en el mundo del cine sonoro y casi al tecnicolor. Hay que decir que se trata de una buena película que plasma bien la historia original, aunque existen algunas diferencias con la novela. La obra original de Oscar Wilde es considerada más bien una historia gótica de horror, debido a que la historia transcurre en la época victoriana y Dorian comete una serie de actos que llevan a que su retrato se corrompa más. La película, por otro lado, se enfoca más en el drama y el romance. Además, los actos que Dorian comete no salen en la película. Lo que está presente es la sospecha sobre la juventud de Dorian y solo se puede ver las sospechas sobre las cosas que Dorian pudo haber hecho al disfrutar de su libertinaje. Cualquiera que haya leído la novela puede entender cuáles son esos actos que se rumorean, pero que no son mencionados en la película. Aun así, la película no desecha del todo la esencia del personaje, ya que se puede ver como Dorian es un hombre que por fuera luce como alguien decente, pero su comportamiento frívolo y vanidoso deja en claro que tiene oscuros secretos. Eso se ve mucho más reflejado en el retrato que tiene bastante del aire de horror que caracteriza gran parte de la obra. Aquí vemos una versión bastante desagradable del retrato que ya dice mucho sobre las cosas que Dorian pudo haber hecho. En la película vemos como Dorian comienza lentamente a tomar consciencia sobre como su presencia parece provocar la muerte de quienes lo rodean. Cuando Dorian se para frente al retrato viendo reflejado los pecados que ha cometido, es como si el retrato fuera una especie de alegoría sobre vernos a nosotros mismos reflejados en algo como parecido en un espejo y que ahí vemos ese lado horrendo de nuestra persona que muchas veces no queremos ver. Si la película no hubiese dejado de lado gran parte de los actos que Dorian cometió, hubiera aportado bastante para fortalecer este concepto que la película da sobre Dorian y toda su inmoralidad reflejada en el retrato. Además, hay que decir que las pocas escenas que muestran el retrato en color no eran del todo necesarias, aunque hay que admitir que la escena del retrato corrompido en color logra generar bastante impacto por su aspecto repulsivo. Así que no se puede negar que The Picture Of Dorian Gray es una buena película con un buen argumento y buenos actores. A pesar de tener sus diferencias con la novela, es ideal para empezar a conocer la obra de Wilde. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 8/10.

Review: Based on the Oscar Wilde novel of the same name, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a surprisingly effective adaptation of the classic book. Thanks to some Oscar-winning cinematography, which includes some beautiful deep-focus shots, along with fantastic lighting, detailed sets, and a chilling performance by Hurd Hatfield in the lead role, the movie is a fascinating look at one man's quest for pleasure and beauty and the sacrifice he is willing to make to achieve his goal. While the film probably could have done without the ever-present narrator, which becomes a bit of an annoyance, the movie holds the viewer's from beginning to end and still packs a punch seventy-five years later.

Review: What I love about this movie are George Sanders's lines. He's the Oscar Wilde stand-in, except hetero and upstanding. But then, this dumb, naive kid, Dorian Gray, decides to live his life by them, disregarding any morality. There is subtext galore here.

Movie name: The Picture of Dorian Gray
Review: The movie is hopelessly handicapped by the wooden, stiff, unconvincing non-performance of it's star, Hurd Hatfield. The portrait, itself, has more charisma, charm, talent and star quality than does Mr. Hatfield. "Dorian," John Gray, is not the beautiful Adonis Wilde described in his story. Perhaps, this is why the director filmed him in "soft focus," heavy makeup, allowing him to express no sign of humor or life. I don't believe Mr. Hatfield smiled once. George Sanders gives the only performance worth watching. This movie needed a better director and a better casting director.

Review: Best Verson Available Of all the adaptions, this movie is the best by far. There are grave errors, however. Firstly, the acting is not good. Henry (Harry), in perticular, carelessly spoke his lines and at times they stringed all together. The actual character is supposed to have gravitas, drawing his audience in with his ludicrous theories. This version also reeks of Hollywood gimmick. For some reason it felt the need to attribute the supernatural occurrence of the portrait with some random Cat statue that is vaguely Egyptian. A new character is added for no reason. Gladis, the daughter of Basil, never existed in the book. It takes the loneliness out of the Dorian and drives away the horrid and scandalous behavior in the book. Hopefully, there will be a film that stays true to the book. For now, this is the best we've got.

Movie name: The Picture of Dorian Gray
Review: A film adaptation of one of the legendary Oscar Wilde's literary works, "The Picture of Dorian Gray" embodies many of the gothic and haunting qualities of 1940's Dramas and Horrors. This film is a combination of both film genres as it tells a reality-mixed-with-fantasy story that remains relatable over a century later (take a look at pop culture's love of selfies during the 2010s versus a painted portrait of oneself from decades past). Despite over relying on a narrator to tell the original literature and some rushed scenes when characters need to talk to one another, this 1945 adaptation delivers the suspense through beautifully shot camera work, huge sets (to make one feel small), and stinging music. The crew wisely invest in technicolour to shoot the portrait in to greatly show the beauty and the horror that it encapsulates. It brings a care of attention to the largely black and white film. Not only that, but the painting looks splendid in both depictions! Therefore, I give a shout out to those artists that worked on them. I must also compliment Hurd Hatfield's performance as the titular character. It is he who also helps keep the film suspenseful and interesting. As Dorian, Hatfield delivers a performance that starts as naive and innocent, but as the film progresses, he becomes increasingly quirky, dark, uneasy, and creepy through his body language, mannerisms (he starts playing with a knife near the end of the film), speech, and even his piano playing. I don't think "The Picture of Dorian Gray" will immediately grab everybody's attention and I don't know how accurate this adaptation is from the book, but for my experience, the film grew on me like a pulsating fungus from beginning to end. It left my imagination open to consider what crimes Dorian may or may not have performed outside of the tragedies he was responsible for that are shown on film. Furthermore, the take home message really is one that is powerful and it amazes me how true it continues to be to this very day. I think this film deserves more recognition and it makes me want to read Wilde's original piece.

Review: If there were ever a contradictory but appreciative film category the term ˋtrash masterpiece ´ would certainly apply to this utterly absurd, on the one hand & a memorably involving experience on the other. Pauline Kael, I believe, came up with a term regarding enjoyably trashy movies & here is one of the greatest examples. Gene Tierney, mainly thanks to LAURA, was a huge star by this time & gives a no holds barred performance, that never ceases to fascinate. Sitting on a boat in the middle of a lake in ominous dark glasses & impassively watching her husband‘s crippled younger brother drown is one of the creepiest scenes of sheer depraved yet understated selfish jealousy that I have ever seen. It, momentarily, puts the whole film on another level. Tierney had another go at a selfish character the next year with THE RAZOR‘ EDGE but seldom returned to roles of such selfish depravity. Great roles seldom came her way thereafter which is unfortunate but one more remained for certain - THE GHOST & MRS. MUIR in 1947. She remains one of my favorite actresses during these years & really deserved better roles as time went on. Another great moment in LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN has Tierney‘s character riding with her horse over the New Mexico landscape tossing her father‘s ashes to the winds. Some of the melodramatics were, for me, a bit much especially with Vincent Price‘s scenery chewing. However that’s appropriate for the situation, I guess. Cornel Wilde & his performance do not exactly light up the screen & he fares better as an actor in some film noirs down the road. A special mention of praise for Leon Shamroy‘s color photography which deservedly won him an Oscar. A real & rare treat if one is in the mood & I often need a fix of this crazy & wonderful film of which. I fortunately own a DVD.

Review: I found the lead actor a little unappealing so couldn't get what the obsession was from Ellen - she had some great clothes. The title is rather silly and doesn't add to the theme of the movie at all unless its a old Hollywood tip of the hat to religion which otherwise is missing from the whole story. Its visually interesting to watch the sets, the fussy Bar Harbour set which looks like a stage set and the fake outdoors in some parts, but worth a look to see how gorgeous the lead lady was and also Jeanne Craig... my sympathies are drawn to Ellen's mother whose marriage was ruined by the daughter and who obviously liked her adopted daughter much more.

Movie name: Leave Her to Heaven
Review: A really strange technicolor noir/melodrama. As silly as a lot of the movie is, there is something strangely beguiling about it. I think the key ingredient is Tierney who gives a performance that sidesteps a lot of the era's conventional femme fatale traits (more subtle and unnerving than outwardly evil) even after she's exposed to the other characters. Also, everyone involved plays this thing straight without much overacting which invites the audience to take all of this seriously.

Review: 1945! Psychological thriller. Very interesting. GREAT CAST!: CORNELL WILDE!, beautiful GENE TIERNEY!, & Jeanne CRAIN! & a younger CHILL WILLS. Great natural scenery. Very high reviews. Never heard of until saw it on the tv setJuly 6, 2022 & saw much of it again, a few weeks later. It becomes a histrionic courtroom drama, with prosecutor VINCENT PRICE badgering the witnesses on the stand in amanner that would be objection sustained. The most memorable scene was the intentional standing by and letting the young son die while swimming in a bucolic lake after eating a meal and getting the gramps. She crazy, you know.

Review: Delight in the wickedness of jealousy. John M. Stahl's psychological thriller Leave Her to Heaven (1945) is one of the most entertaining film noirs ever made. Stahl devotes his camera and direction to allowing the audience to glance at her realistic insanity of possessiveness of Ellen Berent Harland with close-ups on Gene Tierney's cold, icy blue eyes. She is just sublime as Ellen as she quietly loathes anyone that would take up her man's attention, so she manipulates everyone and everything around her to fit her jaded little world. It's a shocking lead actress performance that should have won Tierney an Oscar. Unfortunately, she was up against Mildred Pierce in Joan Crawford. Leave Her to Heaven is simply gorgeous in every frame with a dedication to Gene Tierney's flawless looks and nuanced acting. Cornel Wilde's lead actor role as Richard Harland is interesting because he feels like a regular guy, who suffers endlessly, yet he falls for Gene Tierney's femme fatale facade. His hollowed eyes are devastating when he confronts her for her crimes. He gives a fantastically understated performance that rivals Gene Tierney's unholy terror leading lady. He has sweet chemistry with the lovely Jeanne Crain's role as Ellen's affectionate sister named Ruth Berent. Jeanne Crain acts so beautifully with her kind and gentle eyes that you immediately feel the love Ruth has for Richard in her first scene together with Cornel Wilde. She's the opposite of the frosty evil that is the devilishly charming Gene Tierney. Vincent Price delivers a striking prosecution monologue that rivals any great courtroom drama speech as the vindictive and intense Russell Quinton. Vincent Price never gave a bad performance and Leave Her to Heaven is yet another classic role from the master of horror in a legendary film noir no less! Mary Philips is nice as Ellen's worried and forlorn mother Mrs. Berent, who knows her daughter is all too loving. Ray Collins is fun as Glen Robie with his expressive narration and warm character. Darryl Hickman gives a believable performance as Danny Harland with his natural acting like he has polio. His fun loving personality comes across as genuine, especially when he's talking about his love of his older brother Richard. Leave Her to Heaven explores many serious and groundbreaking concepts for 1945. Author Ben Ames Williams writes about intense jealousy, absolute obsession, romantic possession, cruel manipulation, selfish neediness, multiple personas, sociopathic wickedness as themes. Using murder as a means of control and isolation is beyond wicked and shocking. Editor James B. Clark keeps 110 minutes down to a brisk pace of nonstop references to Ellen's need for Richard's love. Leon Shamroy's iconic cinematography uses the heavenly natural environment to feel isolating and Thomas Little's lavishly cozy sets to appear cramped for our villainess. Jo Swerling's script writing sees Ellen desire to share secrets, know all thoughts, suggest isolating people, and be aware of his location at all times. Everything is labelled with her initials from robes to towels is just another example of her possessiveness. I must mention the spoiler in that letting a young boy suffering from polio drown, tripping on purpose to miscarry her unwanted baby, and even poisoning herself to manipulate the courts to convict her own doting sister of murder are outrageously cunning. Leave Her to Heaven is still shocking and unnerving with a stunning antagonist in the realm of Misery or The Age of Innocence. I adore Alfred Newman's dark and moody score that gives the viewer a clue of the menace you are witnessing on screen. Kay Nelson's every costume for Gene Tierney and Jeanne Crain are truly breathtaking with pops of color and intricate designs in every scene. You'll love Ben Nye's resplendent make-up, blush and all. In conclusion, John M. Stahl did not falter for a moment in his sterling direction. Gene Tierney needs to be seen in an all time great acting role within Leave Her to Heaven.

Movie name: Leave Her to Heaven
Review: This film is insufferable bad, a strained melodrama that borders on farce. I won't waste time trying to detail all of its egregious faults, but instead can just summarize by saying the entire production is incredibly stilted, phony, crudely dramatized, and emotionally flat. The story line might seem promising on paper, but the script is filled with preposterous dialogue and situations, and the performances by most of the principle actors so awkward, unnatural and cliched that the whole thing collapses into cringe-worthy hokum. I know this has to be graded on a curve because it was made in the 1940s, but there are much better films from that period than this badly dated, forced and fraudulent drama. The opening scenes are downright weird, as Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde stare at each other like they're in a trance and engage in this strangely affected and disjointed dialogue. The two actors seem to think a long, stiff serious look is pregnant with emotional complexity when it's just a vacant expression here. Their interaction throughout the film never comes close to being authentic or natural, much less yielding true chemistry. The cliched situations and the strained conversation between various characters get more contrived, implausible and annoying from there, until the point in the film when obsessive, self-absorbed Ellen (Gene Tierney) becomes truly psycho. This depiction of a femme fatal is psychologically simple-minded and unintentionally comical. Cornel Wilde's performance as writer Richard Horland is equally strange and inauthentic, at times devoid of emotion or convincing motivation. When Ellen admits to letting his beloved, disabled younger brother drown so she can have Richard entirely to herself, Richard takes on this mock serious look for a minute or two, then simply announces "I'm leaving you" and walks away, with no further condemnation of the heartless wife or mention of the fact that what she's done amounts to depraved indifference homicide. This is just one of many bizarre scenes that shred credibility. Virtually every scene features men and women in casual settings but wearing their finest dress attire as if prepped for a fancy cocktail party or evening at the most upscale restaurant. I was curious to see a film starring Gene Tierney, but I was totally underwhelmed with her look and her acting. She has a beautiful face—though probably not without the heavy makeup and two-hour coiffing into lustrous curls. Even by the standards of that day, her lower body is heavy, so it appears the camera work is designed to hide it, even when she dons a swimsuit. Like everything about the film, it is about style and superficial appearance, not substance. The closest thing we get to authentic feeling and dialogue is when adopted sister Laura upbraids selfish Ellen for a lifetime of hurting others. If the film contained more of such real feeling, it might be worthy of the Academy Award it won without deserving the honor. The film was shot in Technicolor but looks more like it was shot in black and white then colorized to unreal saturation later. This visual enhancement adds another layer of repellent phoniness to the whole affair. The film has been variously described as a psychological thriller, film noir, melodrama and other genre terms that don't fit well on something so artificial and strained. Call it blah noir. What is does have is some unintentional laughs thanks to the pretentious language of its male lead (Cornel Wilde) and the ponderous pseudo-mystery of its deranged femme fatale, a woman with too many contradictory emotions, none of which ever ring true. The decorous and silly soap opera drowns by the weight of pretentious dialogue, implausible situations, and ponderous acting by its unconvincing leads.

Review: It's ironic that possibly the best film noir was shot in blazing Technicolor. Playing one of the most complex and malevolent femme fatales in cinematic history, Gene Tierney's sub-zero performance belongs in the same class as prime Bacall or Bergman. A stone cold killer with a thought-provoking storyline and Oscar-winning cinematography worthy of five stars.

Movie name: Leave Her to Heaven
Review: Gene Tierney is one of Hollywood's most beautiful actresses and the camera work and direction here makes her even more radiant. She is absolutely startlingly and stunningly beautiful and it is worth watching this film to see how exquisitely she is made up and lit. I was in love with her in "Laura" and totally besotted here. And yet, the mediocrity of the plot and the wooden script had me stopping the film every ten minutes just to take a break. Time Magazine's review when this film was first released said, "The unhappy story moves through breathtakingly stylish country interiors which make no particular point except to show that the characters have plenty of chintz-upholstered leisure for getting into mischief." Give yourself up to the sheer visual splendor of this movie and forgive Tierney and Cornel Wilde for their over-the-top performances in what is a contrived and absurd story. And enjoy Vincent Price who has little to work with and yet holds his own.

Review: A strange little film with unreasonably high T-metering that moves slowly to a near-the-end courtroom scene with the most annoying Vincent Price as prosecutor performance (& jilted old love) imaginable - & where the defense attorney did nothing to quiet him. Women like this exist, for sure - & stalker men - but not quite this cracked. Leave her to the devil. Really, the results of the old 3-strip Technicolor process was more interesting to look at than the film, never a good sign. And a quirky role for Gene Tierney. + Trivia: Amazing that Jeanne Crain went on to have 7 children!

Review: Anna Owens lied about just about everything, even her own name. On top of that this movie uses some of the most offensive stereotypes since "Birth Of A Nation". Harrison starred in some great movies but I hope he was ashamed of this one.

Review: An unjustly ignored film given that it's really still the best version of this story. Harrison's performance as the titular king will probably skirt the bounds of racial discomfort for modern audiences ... but he successfully stays on the side of good taste. It's a testament to what a magnificent actor he truly was. This version is darker than any subsequent versions, and really is a wonderfully effective melodrama.

Review: First take on this story, and definitely not the best. Primarily because of course, the King of Siam is played, yes, by Rex Harrison. and that's a big stumbling point. Even he can't pull such a task off without looking ridiculous. Aside from that, the story itself, while just a tad bit longwinded, is fine. It actually adds some elements that I wasn't aware of, not mentioned in any of the other movies, and therefore begs of more research. Irene Dunne plays a fine Anna actually, but the Non-Asians playing Asians (there's plenty more) definitely takes this down a notch.

Movie name: Anna and the King of Siam
Review: I wasn't sure I would be able to handle Rex Harrison as the King of Siam, but he manages to pull it off nicely. Very entertaining version of the classic story and a nice peformance from Irene Dunne as Anna. The sets and costumes are excellent and the score is nice as well. I also really liked Gale Sondergaard as the mother of the King's eldest son. A lot of nice and funny moments between Dunne and Harrison, I especially liked the scene where they write to Lincoln, as well as the dinner with the Europeans. I felt it lost a lot of its charm after Anna's son left the picture, but it's still a very fun movie.

Review: Anna and the King of Siam is a good film. Irene Dunn and Rex Harrison worked well together. I thought it was a good film with an interesting story.

Movie name: Anna and the King of Siam
Review: The matching of Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison works very well in this dramatic treatment that re-dates the much better known musical version 'The King and I'. Irene Dunn is at her headstrong best as Anna Owens, but Harrison is the real treat here as the King of Siam - boisterous, comic and tyrannical, a terrific performance. Most unusual casting of Lee J. Cobb in he role of the King's regent - while Harrison manages to suspend your disbelief playing an Asian, Cobb has his work cut out for him!

Movie name: The Yearling
Review: While doing something else for work, the tv remained on the movie channel from a prior view. For a bit of time, I gleaned that a classic film was being presented, " The Yearling". With the pink smoke slithering into my NJ home, the news "ablaze" with more political pathos, and so little here and now fare otherwise worthwhile to watch, the film got my head to turn around. I was not going to get taken in by a barely plain spoken, hinterland family, with animals playing the acting leads, in a world unrecognizable. It got me. It was not sentiment for sentimentalism. It was not the typical one or even two-dimensional kid, nor is his pet, The aw-shucks accents flowed naturally by a totally believable Gregory Peck, the man in the grey flannel suit, after all. I hated that my heart and soul surrendered without my permission. It seems to me that every element of the film knew it was heart stirring and placed hurt deeply within the audience, young and old. It made no apology for that intention. That is part of the genius success. This accidental viewing converted my day, stuck inside with pink yuck smoldering at my window, no work because of the breathless danger, once familiar media turned into stooges of one side or another, turned all this distress & despair into a tissue soaked surprise. And here, decades after "The Yearling's" release, I am writing about it, with immediacy and poignancy. Grateful.

Review: I will never understand the appeal of this film.

Movie name: The Yearling
Review: I was aware of the fact that the book that served as the basis for this film was a Pulitzer Prize winner and that the film Cross Creek (1983) was based on the writer, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, and her life experiences. This meant that I went into this film not expecting a light comedy targeted at family audiences but something of weight and import that would say something about class or difficult family dynamics. While the film touched on uncommonly difficult topics for the time including miscarriages it did turn out to be your run of the mill family film that was unnecessarily long and failed to emotionally manipulate me. In 1878 lonely child Jody Baxter, Claude Jarman Jr., is very close to his kind, loving father Ezra "Penny", Gregory Peck, but struggles in his relationship with his mother Ora, Jane Wyman, who is cold, distant and demanding. The reason for her treatment of him is the trauma that she faces as a result of multiple miscarriages as she believes that if she comes to love her child he will be taken away from her as her other children were. Baxter's life is changed when he finds a young fawn after killing it's mother to treat his father's snake bite wound. He adopts the fawn and names it Flag but he is forced to kill the animal when it starts eating his family's crops and doesn't stop despite Baxter's efforts to keep him away from the crops. He is saddened by the death of his best friend and decides to escape from home but is hurt while in the wilderness. Penny and Ora feverishly search for their son and both are eventually reunited with him as Ora comes to understand that she can openly show love for her son without fear of losing him. Much like King Solomon's Mines (1950) an unusually complex performance from the female lead elevated a bland, lifeless story and what could have been just another supportive, endlessly devoted mother. Wyman is a talented actress as shown by the range she displays between films like The Blue Veil (1951) and All That Heaven Allows (1955) but I assumed that with a screenplay this poor she would be lost under the weight of the schmaltz. Fortunately she is such a radiant, exuberant presence that she dares to make her Ora a downright unlikable character while also subtly hinting at her character's hidden pain. She gets the Southern accent right and her tart comments and palpable frustration with her son make for a fascinating subversion of the sort of mother figures popular in this sort of film. She earned her Best Actress nomination in a very strong lineup and stands out from the rest of this irritatingly bland film to give a uniquely fascinating performance. The rest of the film is the same old, same old as a sweet moppet of a child grows up through raising a similarly immature animal and becomes a man when he learns to let his companion go. This story is dealt with in more depth in the darker Kes (1969) which tackles the pain of an angry, disadvantaged youth surrounded by people who simply don't care. In this film Penny, played with stolid charm by a typecast Peck, is not a character but a perfect father with no imperfections that would humanize him or make his relationship with his son engaging. We know that Jody is lonely as an only child in a remote location but he never seems particularly upset about his circumstances and wears a silly little grin throughout the film that suggests no troubles whatsoever. We don't really know whether this boy's circumstances bother him and so the introduction of this fawn seems like just another positive addition to his charmed life. We are not terribly heartbroken when he loses this fawn and I had full confidence that he would return to his loving parents and be perfectly happy. There is better children's entertainment that was produced in this period as Cover Girl (1944) and Strike Up the Band (1940) offer far more entertainment than this film which is not helped by an unfortunately weak performance from it's young lead who is trying too hard to convey emotion.

Review: SPOILERS: Beautiful, well acted and highly entertaining, this movie is wonderful. I've viewed it many times and have spread its joys to many friends and relatives. I have a friend from work, and we often see each other, shouting out Jody's histronic "Ah HATES yah, I HATES yah and Ah Hopes Ya DIE!" We don't do it to make fun of the movie, we do it because it we instantly get entangled in the deep emotion of that dreadful moment. It makes us laugh, but but it also throws us into the middle of the poor child's histeria and flings us back into our own childhood traumas (which thank heavens were light weight compared to those of poor Jody. Now, I'm not saying the movie doesn't have hilarious moments. My personal favorite is Jody wondering aloud how his smelly pet deer could possible offend his mother's nose. Cracks me up every single time! I think the best actor in this movie is the mother played by Jane Wyman. When she fusses my heart crumbles into dust for her and the losses she suffered prior to having her boy Jody. What heartache it must have been to have so many little graves, each containing a piece of her heart, so close to her home. Oh yeah, and Gregory Peck was good in this movie too. The boy who played Jody is a hoot, and a heartbreaker. That is saying a lot for a time period when children in general couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. I would kill to know what the director must have said to get that kind of performance out of that little neophyte actor.

Review: Wow. This movie was terrible. Other than Gregory Peck, (who somehow manages to appear complex and make the corny cowboy dialog bearable) and Henry Travers (who appears briefly) the acting is worse than ridiculous. The film seemed to want to portray the mother, Orna, as a complicated character who was grieving, but she came across as flaky, erratic and dimwitted, almost to the point of being developmentally challenged, rather than deep. The whole movie is filled with cheap, unimaginative, cinematic cliches (like the boy/fawn frolicking scenes with fake cloud backdrops.) The dialog is painfully bad, with all the characters using some sort of silly spaghetti western-like dialect. Except for the acting of Peck and Henry Travers and the use of a real deer (which must have been difficult and I give them credit for it) this movie was a real disappointment.

Movie name: The Yearling
Review: He ain't a yearling no longer. A poor farming family has an adventurous and imaginative boy who one days finds an abandoned fawn that needs to be nursed back to health. The mother has some hesitancy, but the father feels it will help the boy have a friend and companion. They take the fawn in and as poverty hits the family, tough situations and decisions present themselves. "I want that there dog." Clarence Brown, director of National Velvet, Anna Karenina (1935), Intruder in the Dust, Angels in the Outfield, The Eagle, A Free Soul, and Wonder of Women, delivers The Yearling. The storyline for this picture is entertaining and unfolds well in a Where the Red Fern Grows kind of way. The acting is out of this world good and the cast includes Gregory Peck, Jayne Wyman, Claude Jarman, Clem Bevans, Forrest Tucker, and Henry Travers. "Does a man got to die to find peace?" I came across this Gregory Peck classic on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) and had to DVR it. I really enjoyed this movie. This wasn't an all-time great Peck or classic genre film, but it does deliver the family genre elements that were so prevalent during this era to perfection. I really enjoyed this movie, but I wouldn't add it to my classic genre collection. "Clouds are really just the backs of angels." Grade: B-

Review: There is too much beauty in it. From my point of view this movie has been undersestimated over the years. It has top performances and top direction. Clarence Brown didn't make only a MGM family movie, he made a real masterpiece,and maybe, a new kind of film. This is a real classic and one of the best movies ever made, not only in the United States, but in the history of film. A complete movie.

Review: In contrast to Frank Capra's divine optimism, cruelly tears the shield of children and exposes them under hard reality. But maturity is one takes to survive. Besides the great performance from the leading cast, including Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman, the beautiful countryside and the adorable animals are enough to leave you purring.

Review: If there were the worst way to reimagine a classic tale for a modern audience, it'd be this one.

You have no attention span and you ate here because you lack in life. This movie and many like it are your kryptonote, and you try your hardest to strike them down. At the end of the day, you fear meaning and you lack life. You will pass, but this timeless piece will outlive you. Proceed.

Review: The movie was extremely slow moving for me. Yes, it had beautiful people and beautiful settings. The artwork was banal, but then, the lead wasn't supposed to be a great artist anyway. There were just too many scenes of "she looks at him," "he looks at her," without any real interaction going on. Add in all the interminable pauses in all those worthless scenes, and you get a dud of a movie. It doesn't stack up to Dickens, and his classic novel. The interaction with Robert DeNiro far outstripped the love relationship, and that in itself is a sad commentary on the film.

Movie name: Great Expectations
Review: An engrossing modern take on Charles Dickens' classic novel. Alfonso Cuaron's romance drama Great Expectations (1998) is very endearing for a modern version of an old classic. Charles Dickens' novel captures longing after someone you cannot have as well as class differences in a meaningful way. Mitch Glazer's screenplay is very sincere, so any silly 90's aspects are forgiven for me by virtue of how loving this movie feels. Cuaron adapts the entire novel for contemporary audiences. He gives it an arthouse look with a 1990's style. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is lovely and thoughtful with Dutch angles in wide shots and stunning close-ups. The camerawork instills this sense of something being wrong with each mysterious encounter between lovers. I hope Alfonso Cuaron looks back fondly at his Great Expectations one day for it's magnificent. Ethan Hawke is excellent as Finnegan Bell with his natural charisma and realistic heart. He's so endearing as a young man tricked into love and wealth. He has this raw aura and kinetic energy that just works for this character. You believe Finn is in love because of Hawke's genuine dramatic acting. His eyes say it all. Gwyneth Paltrow is drop dead gorgeous in Great Expectations with an air of superiority and snobbery that perfectly fits the cold man killer Estella with manipulative intentions. She tears through guys with a single glance or smirk. Paltrow knows she looks beautiful and alluring and uses it brilliantly to bring Estella to life with a captivating grace. Gwyneth Paltrow was unstoppable in the 1990's with inspired dramatic role after role of tempting desire and deeply depressed characters. Chris Cooper is very likable as Finn's Uncle Joe. You can see this kind man raising a child, while remaining a normal man at heart. Cooper is very interesting in a nice guy role for once instead of his usual villains. Anne Bancroft is funny and compelling as the miserable bachelorette for life Ms. Nora Dinsmoor. She's toying with Ethan Hawke in every scene as she cruelly uses Finn for her own spite. Robert De Niro is a genius actor as always as Lustig with a serious gravitas and gentle manner alike as the runaway prisoner turned gentleman. Hank Azaria is funny as the foolish Walter Plane, who is being used by Estella. Kim Dickens is very pretty and intriguing as Finn's older sister Maggie. Nell Campbell, from Rocky Horror Picture Show, has a supporting role as the German art organizer Erica Thall. Lastly, Lance Reddick cameos as art collector Anton Le Farge in a funny event scene. Steven Weisberg's editing is steeped in 90's cuts, giving Great Expectations a grounded and dreamy feel for a quick 111 minutes. You are there in every moment of intimate pleasure and pain, while the look of things captures an emotional honesty. It has an indie arthouse feel to it despite being a major motion picture. Tony Burrough's production design has all manner of gorgeous sets and messy living spaces. Susan Bode's luxurious sets are decorated with care. Patrick Doyle's score is romantic and tender in every moment. I really enjoy the random assortment of 90's alternative in the soundtrack as well. Judianna Makovsky's costumes are rich with an alternative 90's chic style. In the end, Alfonso Cuaron was a fantastic director to adapt Charles Dickens' Great Expectations into a contemporary classic drama.

Movie name: Great Expectations
Review: I liked the modern version of "Great Expectations", specifically the removal of satellite characters and other details that you can only understand if you read Dickens' book. However, the main challenge of simplifying a plot to this extent is that it removes the depth associated with the complex personalities of Finn (Pip), Estella, Nora Dinsmoor (Miss Havisham) and Lustig (Magwitch). I appreciate all the thinking needed to modernise the story, so I am impressed by the director's enterprise. In my opinion, perhaps a slightly longer movie would have allowed more time to explore the nature of the relationships between the main characters (Finn, Estella, Joe, Nora and Lustig) and emphasise the complicated romance between Finn and Estella and the surge of feelings derived from it.

Movie name: Black Narcissus
Review: A fascinating journey into a nun's mind. Influential English directors Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell's psychological drama Black Narcissus (1947) is very impressive. Black Narcissus features truly beautiful matte paintings in the backdrop for the Himalayan Mountains. Pressburger and Powell's dark shadows and bright days are very pretty. The high altitude gives atmospheric winds and blowing fabrics in the background. Writers Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell adapt Rumer Godden's story about a nun remembering past love and forming a nunnery in the Himalayas, while another nun finds a forbidden romance. Having nuns, who have sworn to a life of celibacy, deal with the temptation of sex and love in intriguing. Casting director Adele Raymond found excellent English actresses. Deborah Kerr is enthralling and likable as the tough young Mother Superior Sister Clodagh. She is determined and gripping in one of Deborah Kerr's greatest roles. Sabu is entertaining as The Young General Dilip Rai. David Farrar is interesting as the rough and flirtatious Mr. Dean, who tempts Kathleen Byron's feisty and impressionable nun Sister Ruth. Farrar is not afraid of playing Mr. Dean as a jerk and openly flirting with Sister Ruth. Byron is fun with her forceful manner and clear lustful desire for Mr. Dean with her looks of longing. Flora Robson is nice as the pleasant and likable Sister Philippa. Jean Simmons is strangely in brownface, but beautiful and innocent as the young girl Kanchi. Jenny Laird is good as Sister Honey. Judith Furse is great as the helpful and sturdy Sister Briony. Esmond Knight in unfortunate brownface is funny as The Old General, who says the nuns may eat sausages. May Hallatt is crazy as the raving old woman Angu Ayah. Eddie Whaley Jr. is fun as the young interpreter Joseph Anthony. Shaun Noble is pleasant as Clodagh's past sweetheart Con. Nancy Roberts is mean and brutish as the older Mother Superior Dorothea. Editor Reginald Mills does beautiful dissolves, fades, montages, and splices matte paintings neatly to give the illusion of depth in shots. Mills keeps things moving so 100 minutes feels quite short. Cinematographer Jack Cardiff does stunning far wide shots of the mountains. Production designer Alfred Junge's large convent set is neat with traditional Nepalese paintings. All the matte paintings are mesmerizing. I wish every film used them still. Set decorator Vishwanatha Nageshkar got authentic furnishings, paintings, candles, rugs, and more. Special effects artists Sydney Pearson, E. Hague, Jack Higgins, and James Snow do wonderful practical effects throughout Black Narcissus for a dreamy effect on the viewer. Composer Brian Easdale delivers both English symphonic glory and authentic traditional world music to give Black Narcissus a stranger vibe. Sound designers Stanley Lambourne and Gordon K. McCallum does wonderful work capturing the loud winds up in the mountains for constant ambiance. Costume designer Hein Heckroth makes lovely silk outfits for the natives and tremendous large habits for the nuns. Makeup artist George Blackler slaps tons of paint on the British cast playing the natives, but I found it somewhat tasteful without looking too offensive as far as these old films go. Hairstyling from Biddy Chrystal is impressive with tons of different looks. Overall, Back Narcissus is an interesting film about nuns, love, faith, fear, and colonization.

Movie name: Black Narcissus
Review: A Classic Drama of Nuns who struggle with being human in a surreal way. The acting is solid overall but the main problem is because their Nuns they never really show emotion and dress so similar outside of Ruth & Kerr the rest all just sort of blended in. They were still well done but it was hard to tell the differences amongst them because of that. It was great seeing Kerr in flashbacks that helped show emotion. Add onto that the serious acting that came across dry a lot of times as well but it was still well done. The standout here is the drop dead gorgeous cinematography, a hallmark of Powell & Pressburger. Every scene looks like your staring at a beautiful painting and pops, which lifts a lot of the dry acting as well. The music is very good also though I wish it was used a bit more and a little more distinct. The editing and pacing are solid also. While thing just sort of happen when they arrive at the mountain, we stay focused on Kerr majority of the time and she acts as the anchor that ties all the other story arcs together. Though Ruth & Kerr are the only ones that really have solid arcs, none of the rest is really filler. The ending does get surreal and interesting but I wish the rest of the film would've been more like that in the middle where it is consistent but dry and hard to tell the supporting Nuns stories and characters apart. I was very on the fence about giving a 4 or 4.5. But its worth watching just because of how incredible it is to look at, listen too, and it is interesting the whole way with a good ending. Anyone who is a fan of P&P, any actors in this, or dramas will enjoy this. Though it can come across a bit dry throughout, if your a fan of dramas particularly adaptations of novels or British dramas than you'll like this.

Review: I liked the Red Shoes more from Powell, but this physiological drama is ahead of its time and another hallmark of British made technicolor. It's just beautiful to look at but the theme is problematic and abstract.

Movie name: Black Narcissus
Review: While it's lovely to look at, you can't help but get the feeling that Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's Black Narcissus is more style than it is substance. Set in the Himalayas, a group of nuns is dispatched to a decrepit palace high in the mountains in order to establish a convent to provide aid to the local inhabitants. The majority of the film consists of the sisters interacting with the locals, while the last act, which feels like it's tacked on, becomes a sordid melodrama revolving around unrequited love and lost faith. While the cinematography and sets are beautiful, the movie feels as though it falters as the result of uninteresting characters and a lack of any cohesive story. As eye candy, it is great. As an engaging film, it falls a bit short.

Movie name: Black Narcissus
Review: Stunningly photographed (by the great Jack Cardiff), and with astonishing production design that completely disguises that the whole movie was shot in England and on Pinewood soundstages, this strange and haunting study of repressed sexuality and madness among a group of nuns newly relocated to a mountain top monastery, almost defies categorisation. At times it plays like a travelogue, a romance, a domestic drama, but as it proceeds it becomes more and more unsettling. The wind blows, the bell chimes, and Brian Easdale's haunting score tightens the tension. Excellent performances from Deborah Kerr, David Farrar and Kathleen Byron.

Review: I am subtracting a point for the use of brownface. Why is it even necessary? It is a glaring mistake, in my opinion. The rest of the movie is perfect. I loved the use of matte paintings, miniature sets, lighting design, acting performances, and so on. For those who want a fresh interpretation of the story, I would recommend the 2020 mini-series. It stars Gemma Arterton in the leading role.

Movie name: Black Narcissus
Review: Black Narcissus is a deceivingly beautiful film with masterful storytelling rhetoric as well as cinematography, both working in tandem to create constant unrest in tension building with seemingly no cadence even in the ending. The cinematography provokes a rather smooth experience, almost like a silky, misty texture with moderately-pace rhythmic montages. Not only in that the shots are timely to convey this, but each frame also uses compositional transition to lead the eyes effortlessly through the movie. During a sequence, movement would be introduced from outside the frame; either moving in from the sides, from the foreground or background. The few abrupt montages are purposefully used in the climatic sequences. I personally highly appreciate this sort of artful constraints. Shots usually contain the entire body of the actors; mostly in the middle ground; rhetorically similar to the exotic drawings in the bathhouse. With only a few over-the-shoulder shots (unlike in Citizen Kane), the viewing experience is analogous to that of a painting, creating a sort of experience where the viewer would seem to be floating most of the time. There are a few outliers that I found interesting. First are the few tilted camera shots that would induce disorientation to emote unsettlement and urgency. Second is the one and only use of First-Person shot (when Sister Ruth collapses); in this brief second we can almost connect to Ruth's feverish rage. The selective use of dramatic lighting is also something to be cherished. Throughout the film, most of the time the lighting is homogenous, again adding to the misty effect. The only time chiaroscuro is used is to capture Ruth's madness, or in a few frame in the peeking sequence (1:15 - 1:18). This not only heightens the angst evoked by the shots but also give Ruth so much character as the "antagonist" of the film. While cinematograph provides a rather smooth viewing experience turning the attention onto the story, the story is one full of contrasts. A few themes like Christianity vs. Hinduism, colonist vs. native, the sacred vs. the profane comes to mind; but personally Chasity and sex predominates as the story reveals layers of characters' story hinting at strong sexual desire and sexual release. The viewer is left high strung throughout the film; it is only until the goodbye scene do the viewer receive but a subtle contact between Sister Clodaugh and Dean in the hand-holding scene, where Clo almost hesitates to let go of Dean's hand, only to be followed by Dean's longing stare in the departure. Overall the viewing experience is one I did not expect to love and find so enticing. I can appreciate why Scorsese would describe this as an "erotic" film. But I find that in a sense it's a not erotic because it contains explicitly erotic scenes (like we have seen in La Coquille et le Clergyman and Un Chien Andalou), but rather implicit sub-texts in the imageries, dialogues, and thoughts of the characters. It is precisely the lack of an erotic scene that leaves the audience longing, and in that longing is the erotica Scorsese's mentions.

Review: I appreciate the fine acting from the Nuns and the cinematography is great BUT the story is meh. Not that much actually happens. Its far better than the recent BBC TV series of the book which makes me wonder why they bothered, but there is simply not enough in the film. I have no idea if the book contains far more or this is it. If this is it, its too little. Sorry, this may be considered a classic, its just not a classic to me.

Review: If it weren't for the mediocrity of the acting and dialogue, and the awful narration this could have been a classic film noir masterpiece. If you are at all interested in excellent cinephotography ignore all that and see this film. The cinephotographer William Daniels won an Academy Award for his work and anyone with an eye for photography can see why. Shot on the streets of New York, Daniels delivers one masterful street scene after the other that rivals the best street photography of that era: Helen Levit, William Klein, Robert Frank and Cartier Bresson. Each shot on the street is set up like a revelation of New York street life from foreground to deep background. Night photography is mysterious and detailed, broad daylight is exquisite – everywhere you look there is life and action. I will be showing this film to my college students from this day forward. Don't miss it.

Review: As much as Brute Force is about the systemic failings of incarceration, The Naked City (1948) could be read as a reversal in terms of ideology, cheering on the police officers that work so hard to put criminals behind bars. The film is very much a police procedural; a tremendous steppingstone in establishing the path to such institutions as Law & Order and CSI. Crucially, much of it was shot on the functional streets of New York City- a prominent selling point that was fully justified in both its rarity and its you-are-there immersion. The Naked City was not the very first film to have NYC depict itself (see 1945's even more procedural The House on 92nd Street for a valid precursor), though it was among the first. It was also the boldest and most expansive about it. People, people everywhere, bustling about their own lives and concerns. When we're famously told that there are eight million stories in the naked city, we might be inclined to reply, "That's it?"

Review: Something new for the time, but not one I need to see again. A nice look at New York.

Movie name: The Naked City
Review: Jules Dassin uses documentary style snippets of fly on the wall with voice over and comical little glimpses in to the lives of some of the 8 million people of New York as a backdrop to his crime story. Painting the wider picture (literally at first) and then narrowing efficiently gives us a tapenstry of little vignettes, each player in the story seen as a unique person with a life of their own that has started before we see them and doesn't finish when we leave them. This is a masterful stroke, ahead of its time in a way that foreshadows layered and complex modern TV like The Wire. You imagine at any point the film could suddenly switch gears and focus on the medical examiner or the newsagent or the taxi driver and become an entirely different film but one still interested in examining the human condition at the heart of the story and the interconnectedness and crossing paths of all the stories in a city. It's brisk with frames packed full of people; depth and breadth pervading ever scene literally and figuratively. It's a beautiful and restrained picture in true Dassin style and yet also manages to feel alive and real. The omnipresent narrator's cheeky turn becomes sinister in the final chase moments to great effect. An oddly modern and unstuffy film noir.

Movie name: The Naked City
Review: Great film noir ! Amid a semi-documentary portrait of New York and its people, Jean Dexter, an attractive blonde model, is murdered in her apartment. Homicide detectives Dan Muldoon and Jimmy Halloran investigate. Suspicion falls on various shifty characters who all prove to have some connection with a string of apartment burglaries. Then a burglar is found dead who once had an elusive partner named Willie. The climax is a very rapid manhunt sequence. Filmed entirely on location in New York City. The movie is hard-hitting, gripping and a hymn to the excitement . One of Jules Dassin's best features is a quintessential film noir, distinguished by its on-location shooting and Daniels' sharp imagery, which deservedly won the Oscar; Best Cinematography, Black-and-White William H. Daniels & Best Film Editing Paul Weatherwax .

Movie name: The Naked City
Review: Director Jules Dassin delivers a strong detective film in 'The Naked City', a film often described as noir, but which is less hardboiled than others in the genre. The murders at the beginning of the film over deadpan narration are cold-blooded enough, and I loved how the film had such a sense of realism in the methodical police investigation which follows. There are excellent shots all over New York, in the air and on the ground, for which William H. Daniels would win an Oscar for cinematography. There aren't any big stars in the cast, and that adds to the film's appeal, though unfortunately the quality of the acting varies (for example, check out Dorothy Hart's reaction to finding out her friend is dead). Anchoring it all is Barry Fitzgerald, who turns in a strong performance as the veteran Irish-American detective, mentoring a younger cop (Don Taylor), dealing with various crackpots, and putting the squeeze on a habitual liar (Howard Duff), all with wry humor. Dassin was a couple of years away from being blacklisted in Hollywood, and seven from making the iconic Rififi in France, and one can see parallels in how tight and realistic the storytelling is between the two films. Intelligent and stands the test of time ... and oh, I loved that last line - "There are eight million stories in the city; this has been one of them."

Review: A different kind of murder crime drama. Showing the inner workings of the NYC police department.

Movie name: The Naked City
Review: There are millions of stories in New York and we happen to focus in on the most boring of them. This film makes it seem like it's some sort of semi-documentary on the lives of New York City people only because it is terribly dull as a straight police procedural. I give this movie a three-star rating only because it does what it needs to, but nothing jumps out of this movie that would inspire one to be interested in New York City life back in the 40s.

Movie name: The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc
Review: This is a must see epic, absolutely one of my favorites. It's a very well executed movie, brilliantly capturing not just the head spinning, absurd insanity, pain, confusion and uncertainty involved with the life and struggles of Joan of Arc but human existence in general and what we can be trully certain of, if anything. From the very first scenes the breathtaking vistas and cinematography along with excellent cast of fine actors especially the delightful child actress playing her younger self deliver those themes so beautifully. Milla Jovovich was an excellent choice for capturing the unnerving grotesque insanity of it all.

Movie name: The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc
Review: Hoffman delivers a cringe worthy role, well below his worth as an actor, implying Joan was self deluded, mistaking insanity for divine inspiration offering arty, smart ass alternative explanations for events in her life. The film is historically inaccurate in capturing what we know of Joans character, propagating the fictional Joan of modernity, but at the expense of capturing what was both an all too human but remarkable life. And Hoffman, trying to look mysteriously ominous in an American accent is hilarious.

Movie name: The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc
Review: "Are you sure Jeanne?" A ferocity in the introduction, the movie is as confused as the character trapped between paranoia and faith. It could have been more powerful with less battles maybe…I fear that most of the people will see Jeanne d'Arc as a really crazy woman. Mila is not so bad though…

Movie name: The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc
Review: The movie was entertaining but I disliked how Joan was made into something she wasn't. Instead of a saint we got a selfish, revenge driven crazy girl. Some blame Milla for portraying her like that but based on scenes at the end Joan was surely written like that. Also, I wish we got reaction of French, especially Joan's soldier friends to her death and betrayal of their king.

Movie name: The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc
Review: If everything else about "The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc" was abysmal, it would still deserve an A for Jovivich's absolutely mad performance. But luckily, everything else is really quite riveting. There is so much style to the cinematography and the battle scenes are intense and the backstabbing plot turns.. it doesn't end. This is one of my favorite films. I give it an A, make a point to go see this movie.

Movie name: The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc
Review: Have ended up enjoying this on multiple occasions more than expected. It makes good sense for the character of Joan of Arc to be portrayed as she was, I think she'd definitely have to have been ‘the little guy who thinks he's the biggest guy' in order to get her point across and do what she allegedly did. The battle scenes are decent and how she is betrayed in the end is tragic. We have no way of knowing the truth of how it went and how she earned her sainthood but this works for me.

I have enjoyed it more the second time.

Movie name: Battleground
Review: One of the better war films from this era. Like another adaptation of the "Battered Bastards of Bastogne", Band of Brothers. Battleground really helps develop the bond of the men in the 101st Airborne Division. The action is solid and it's shot tremendously, and the direction by William Wellman is also superb.

Movie name: Battleground
Review: One of the first films depicting WW2 which was made just four after the war ended. The biggest problem with this film is the script, which has a lot of cliched and stereotypical lines found in many films from that era. The film also forces a lot of humour in the film, which for the most part doesn't work. The characters are pretty forgettable in the film. I can remember some of the names, the actors who played them and the quirks each character had, but I can't remember anything else significant. This resulted in a problem that when a character died, it didn't feel that significant because many of the characters in the film didn't stand out. The cinematography of the fighting scenes were well done, especially the last fifteen minutes where the horrors of war was effectively displayed. James Whitmore was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role. However, I thought his role was not near as notable as Kennedy, Richardson and Jagger in their nominated roles. I could've seen any number of actors easily play the role of Kinnie. Overall, a well-constructed film that sufficiently displays the terrible impact of war but is severely dated due to its underwhelming script.

Movie name: Battleground
Review: Battleground is a movie about a military division that has the task of keeping the Nazis out of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge. It is a well-made film that focuses less on the actual combat and more on the experience that soldiers have when involved in that combat. It got a little annoying that there were large stretches where I didn't know what was going on, and I wasn't sure what the goal was for the characters. I also had some trouble distinguishing the characters from one another. I picked up on some traits that differentiated people, but I wasn't sure who was who at all times. However, I realized something really cool about this movie about halfway through. Whether it was their intention or not, most of the complaints that I expressed actually help us to get into the mind of those soldiers. The whole point (at least of the first half of the movie) was that the guys didn't know what was going on either, and they didn't know each other all that well. The fact that I felt disoriented and confused helped me see just how difficult the mental aspect of war can be for those engaged in the conflict on the front lines. We also get to see the toll all of this takes on them, and how they are constantly thinking about what it will take for them to get sent home. I don't know if they put enough emphasis on the Nazis' fiendish tactics to demoralize them and encourage surrender, though. It seemed that the men brushed off the taunting without batting an eye. Perhaps the hardest thing for me to follow in the film was figuring out who was in charge at any given time. It got really confused for me, because I thought Van Johnson was running things at one point, but at the end James Whitmore is acting like the man in charge. While I can forgive the general confusion of who everyone is, it is harder for me to accept the fact that they don't make it clear what everyone is responsible for doing at any given time. I should always be able to easily tell who is the commanding officer. Despite some shortcomings, Battleground is a quality war film, and one that I think delivers a relatively authentic experience.

Movie name: Battleground
Review: Possibly the most accurate movie portrayal out there of World War II. The movie has some good battle scenes but the best part is actually that it doesn't rely on the battles to be a good movie. The viewer is shown their day-to-day life and struggle in the war, which is actually made quite interesting.

Review: Van Johnson stars in this film story of the Battle of The Bulge. Directed by William A. Wellman and also starring an Oscar nominated James Whitmore, John Hodiak, Ricardo Montalban and George Murphy. Also, there's an Oscar winning script from Robert Pirosh.

Movie name: Battleground
Review: William A. Wellman directed this solid war film about a platoon in the waining day of the WWII European theater. It's a grittier and more realistic version of war than your average rah rah John Wayne war film. It's was probably a lot more edgy in it's time, and it's certainly not "Johnny Got His Gun" or even "Saving Private Ryan" but it does present, to a degree, the unpleasant aspect of war. And although it's a rather star studded film (with Van Johnson, Ricardo Montalban, Richard Jaeckel, James Whitmore and James Arness) that doesn't distract from the filim. The main real weak point of the film is the rather cliched characters, but it's a good film none-the-less.

Review: The Battered Bastards Of Bastogne--A Gem!!

Movie name: Battleground
Review: Tried to be character driven but ended up being quite ordinary.

Movie name: Battleground
Review: This movie was good in the aspect of depicting life as an American soldier in Europe during World War II. Particularly taking into account the time the movie was released, the US was filled with heavy propaganda, so to depict soldiers who were not entirely happy to be where they were, and not at all times for the cause is historically significant. The cinematography, for which it won an award for, is well done, again taking into account the time period. As for the story itself, however, I did not enjoy it. These older war movies all seem very similar to each other. I found myself uninterested a lot of times. There seemed to be no clear cut storyline, where you wondered what would happen next. It was basically clips of military camps and battles; which is indeed what it is to be a soldier, but it doesn't make for a very good story.

Movie name: Battleground
Review: Compelling and gritty story focusing on the experiences of a single platoon of the US 101st Airborne during the horrendous conditions of the siege of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944. James Whitmore is the grizzled sargeant, with Marshall Thompson, Van Johnson, John Hodiak and Ricardo Montalban.

Review: great classic WWII movie, black and white filmed, not much combat, centered around the battle of the bulge.

Movie name: Battleground
Review: William Wellman's Battleground is the story about the Siege of Bastogne that took place in Belgium on the Christmas of 1944, where american soldiers was send to the Ardennes forrest to stop a German surprise attack. It was snowing all the time and there was also a thick fog, which made it impossible for airplanes to bomb the Germans. And there were also enemy soldiers dressed up as Americans. The Americans were basically trapped in the woods, with a sinking moral. Battleground is a well crafted war film. I can see that this movie was made by someone who actually have been in combat, at least compared to other movies of its time. You have all the conversations and all the small tiny details, such as the shoulder pads and all the regulations and drills. Pretty much like in the real army. It's a movie with a lot of small talk and some exhilarating battle sequences. The cast is also great, with all the familiar types, like the rookie kid who becomes a man. And the tough but reliable tobacco chewer, Sgt. Kinnie, played brilliantly by James Whitmore. Battleground does not feel like the usual patriotic war picture of the forties. It's an entertaining film, but at the same time it's a film that you take seriously. Thumbs up.

Review: Its often too overtly sentimental but it still has those quiet moments where Ford's imagery more effectively communicates emotions and meaning. Also this is one of the best uses of John Wayne.

Movie name: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Review: Only Wayne fans need apply.

Movie name: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Review: Fairly anti climactic tale of a sergeant on his final patrol before retiring. Wayne is playing a pretty straight up old timer Wild West hero and there's a girl wearing a yellow ribbon as a sign of her affection for one member of the cavalry. You'd think there'd be a lot more to the film but actually that synopsis is effectively a spoiler. Some lovely shots of the desert are the only redeeming feature. A pretty poor western with a strangely good reputation.

Movie name: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Review: This is a Ford & Wayne Classic but it does have problems. The acting is solid with Wayne being a very good standout but the supporting cast while good doesn't really stand out that much except for Bond and he's not even in much of the movie. Everyone just sort of blends in and I can't tell much difference between Johnson, Carey and the like. They still are well acted but don't really stand out. And Dru doesn't really add much and isn't bad but shes the weakest thing here and feels unneeded. The music is excellent and is the best thing in this and is really catchy and memorable. The cinematography is really good and has epic sweeping shots that pop and are super memorable. The only issue is during the night scenes scattered throughout including the big horse climax stampede it's so dark you can't really see what is happening too well sometimes not at all. The action scenes though are amazing to look at. The editing and pacing are solid but this has two main issues. First the story of the calvary journey isn't as tight as other Western journeys like Red River or Stagecoach. It feels like things just happen at times like they get attacked, than they go around, than they meet others and it never really builds on each other. Although they are well shot, well acted, and have great music scenes to boot. The other is the romance between Dru and the others feels out of place and sort of hammed in. Not as bad as say Tess in Red River but it doesn't really add much. The scene where Ward Bond goes on a drunken fight for 7 minutes felt completely out of place also, too slap sticky, and didn't add anything. I was very confused why that was in there. Everything is still solidly put together though. Anyone who is a fan of Ford, any actors in this, or classic westerns will like this.

Movie name: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Review: The Duke and John Ford return to Monument Valley a decade after Stagecoach, with a 42 year old Wayne no longer "The Kid" but a cavalry officer on the eve of retirement, courtesy of the makeup department. Ford's hand-picked Technicolor wizard of a cinematographer works his magic with the panoramic vistas offered by the location and a lighting director does likewise on the sound stage shots, but unlike 1939's film there's little character development and no Thomas Mitchell or John Carradine to bring a script to life. Of course the post-war American audience is given no reason to think that the assorted tribal nations have any legitimate basis for opposing the US Cavalry or the white settlers taking possession of their ancestral territory. There's a muddled love triangle thrown in to justify the film's title.

Review: Outstanding movie; great acting; they dont make them like this anymore; loved it.

Movie name: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Review: Wow. This movie had a great setup. A remote cavalry detachment in the Wild West shortly after Custer's last stand at the Little Bighorn. Ten thousand Indians from a dozen tribes banding together to drive whites from the Great Plains once and for all. John Wayne. A hint of romance. And then it proceeds to not deliver on any of those things. A real letdown. I kept expecting a big fight between the cavalry and the Indians, and instead the cavalry just steals some horses and the only major action happens offscreen. A snoozer, to be sure.

Movie name: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Review: Classic post-WWII John Wayne & Co. Beautifully filmed in Monument Valley, Utah, the film paints a stark contrast between the good US Cavalry and the savage Indians. The acting on the part of the Cavalry and the white women, especially Wayne himself, is superb. The Indians are simply a savage mob. Useful to see for historical purposes, but fortunately much better Westerns were to come.

Review: John Ford (The Long Gray Line, Gideon's Day) and John Wayne (Baby Face, Operation Pacific) most underrated Western collaboration thanks to its beautiful Oscar Winning Cinematography and complex story

Movie name: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Review: One of the least demanding of the Ford Westerns, featuring simple characters and a plot that is unburdened by 'nuance' or 'thoughtfulness', but damn is it pretty. The colors and on-location shooting really make for a stunning looking film considering its pre-1950 release date; this is as good as it gets for Technicolor. However, the film has plenty of weaknesses that stem in part from it being a product of its time (the strange Chaplin-esque bar fight pasted into the runtime, the antiquated portrayal of the Native Americans lacking both differentiation in anything but name and any sort of contextual perspective, the very 1950s perceptions and reverence of individuals like Custer and Lee), but other Ford films have shown that he could be far more creative and intelligent with his plots and character development, so I'm less inclined to forgive the film on those points. The film is very light on plot, and instead meanders through a series of interactions of a uniform group of characters, but still expects the audience to feel empathy and resonate with them; the romantic conflict between two young officers vying for a young woman's affections in particular is threadbare. To me, this isn't a classic among Westerns, a genre that can claim some of the best American films ever made, but instead a beatifully shot but otherwise poorly aged old blockbuster. (3/5)

Movie name: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Review: One of the first and best Western I ever saw. Love John Wayne/John Ford films. Full of majestic backdrops and excellent acting.

Movie name: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Review: "Drama [from James Warner Bellah's story] of the undermanned US Cavalry post far out in the Indian country is centered on a veteran captain about to retire. It develops into a saga of the cavalry, its hard-bitten men, loyal wives and usual intrigues. The tale moves along easily as it shows how the troop surmounts the Indian peril. There's hardly a breather from the time the audience is tipped that John Wayne is soon retiring as cavalry captain til he finalizes his last dramatic moment. Wayne wears well in this somewhat older characterization. He makes the officer an understanding, two-fisted guy without overdoing it. Victor McLaglen gives the production tremendous lift as the whisky-nipping non-com."

Movie name: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Review: Bad plot and the demonization of native Americans continues. John Wayne is wooden as John Wayne, a man who could not act, but only played himself in hundreds of movies. The great cinematography cannot save this dud. John Wayne curses any movie he is in and robs it of its potential for greatness.

Movie name: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Review: Captain Nathan Brittles, on the eve of retirement, takes out a last patrol to stop an impending massive Indian attack. Encumbered by women who must be evacuated, Brittles finds his mission imperiled. This earned an Oscar for Best Cinematography, though had a Best Makeup award existed back then, surely Don Cash would have been a contender for superb work that allowed a then-41-year-old Wayne to convincingly pass for someone a quarter-century older.Also includes the greatest performance ever put in by Victor McLaglen in his reoccurring role as Sgt. Quincannon. The second of John Ford's cavalry trilogy is well acted by John Wayne and well shot by Winton C. Hoch John Wayne, John Ford, and Monument Valley in glorious color. What more can you ask for in a western

Review: Fine Wayne war movie just without much war....a little disappointed in that but overall it is well done.

Movie name: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
Review: The second of the John Ford/John Wayne films known as the Cavalry trilogy. I appear to be watching them backwards! Anyway. Standard Ford stock for me in the Monument Valley location photography. Brilliant as it is, especially in full colour. The make up effects on Wayne to make him appear as a Cavalry officer on the brink of retirement were excellent. If you didn't know before hand you would take him for a mid/late sixties guy not the 41 he was at the time. The story is of the impending retirement of Captain Nathan Brittles who has one final mission to commandeer one last patrol. The patrol faces danger from Indians who have just defeated Custer and the 7th Cavalry of the U.S. army. He is also hampered having to escort two rather peculiar members of the patrol. Two female relatives of his Fort Commander! Wayne shows his acting skills go beyond riding a horse and downing a whisky when he shows real emotion at receiving a retirement gift from his Cavalry soldiers. To avert war Brittles meets the Indian Chief in person. She Wore A Yellow Ribbon falls short of the brilliance of The Searchers but the location photography makes a pretty standard storyline stand out from your average Western of the period. The Ford/Wayne film partnership comes up trumps yet again. To appreciate the full brilliance of the Cinematography watch a high definition version. The DVD doesn't do it justice. Now for the first of the trilogy.

Review: One of the defining noir films, The Third Man was a great film that kept me quite engaged the whole time. It's a delight to see the mystery being put together through the amazing writing. The highlight of this film was definitely the last part with the thrilling sewer chase and haunting final shot.

Movie name: The Third Man
Review: 3.5 stars; This was my third time seeing The Third Man. Each time I see it, I appreciate it as a classic a little bit more. I truly love the cinematography, and the music is haunting. I guess I'm just not that sophisticated at movie critique. Just about any reference to this film features the iconic performance of Orson Welles. I guess I missed the point. To me, Joseph Cotten was the star. Mr. Welles did not show up until two-thirds of the way through the movie. Trevor Howard and Alida Valli played more significant roles. Carol Reed and Graham Greene should also be lauded for their contributions to this classic.

Movie name: The Third Man

Review: Comprehensively outstanding and a work of genius. The film is peerless and is a template for the understated, the quiet, the timing and the brief glimpse into the soul of despair. I suppose it's the dialogue - Graham Greene - and the Catholic requirement for spiritual closure to allow you to move on. But watching Holly waiting for Anna as she walks down the cemetery road makes you realise that life will never be the same. The B and W shades, the angles and the shadows empathise with the monochromatic world of resignation that only the lost will know. It's not known as the greatest film ever made for nothing. It is something, believe me.

Review: Sometimes you think you know a person, only to learn that you never knew him at all!

Shot in visually striking setting, this intriguing noir manages to make its mark on cinema forever!

Review: THE THIRD MAN is understandably a classic, and holds up remarkably well today. Its influence is so pervasive that the film feels familiar, even on first viewing, and while the plot doesn't offer many surprises, the cinematography really is incredible.

Movie name: The Third Man
Review: "The Third Man" is a really good example of good filmmaking for its time. The performances are good and there is a focus on storytelling. I liked the intrigue set up by the beginning of this movie quite a bit and think the movie relies heavily on a slick and engaging atmosphere. I think the finale is exciting and well-made, but I'll be honest I'm not sure I loved the direction the story took. I can safely say it subverted my expectations, but maybe the setup just made me expect something else. Nonetheless, this is a really cool movie that is paced a lot quicker than many older films and one that is definitely well made, and also likely influenced many crime thrillers to come down the line.

Review: Entertaining and much better than I expected. Patrick Swayze's Alan Quatermain was believable. But my favorite film version of this fantasy African adventure story is the one with Stewart Grainger and Deborah Kerr from 1950.

Review: What should have been an exciting re-telling of a classic novel from the late 19th Century ends up being a 4 hour long ho-hum Indiana Jones clone. Swayze still in great shape though.

Review: Yet another adaptation of the novel quite far from the original. This one tends more towards previous movie with Richard Chamberlain and Indiana Jones series than the book. Cast is good, but problem of this mini-series is low budget.

Review: KING SOLOMON'S MINES Fairly good movie but somewhat lack-luster although it has its moments. This film is reminiscent of the Indiana Jones movies by which it is greatly overshadowed. Nonetheless, it is an interesting story line loosely based upon the novel by H. Rider Haggard and his character, Alan Quatermain. Patrick Swayze is believable in this leading role and seemed to have a genuine feel for it. On the whole the film features decent acting performances although at times the plot seems a little too pat and dry as if the actors were merely going through the motions. For example, tribal gatherings are uber-choreographed and come across as simply unnatural. On the other hand, realistic stunt work especially in Patrick Swayze's one-on-one fight scenes, make the plot work out fine. Impressive cinematography of South Africa's native wildlife, varied terrain, and colorful landscape, i.e. rolling mountain vistas, sandy and parched desert areas, and sweeping savannah.

Review: This is a far cry from the book. or from the Stewart Granger version. Not for purists but overall an enjoyable little flick. you just gotta love the scenery, the shots are absolutely beautiful, enhancing a sense of desolateness of the perrenial african land. Sidede Onyulo is very likeable as the wise lost chieftain returning home with th help of Quatermain..his presence is noble and elegant and well played. Though of course you might roll your eyes at another prematurely wise tribesman, a figure which does tend to crop up not infrequently. Nonetheless, he was a fine actor. Ensemble cast is well-chosen. As for the main cast, Patriock Swayze makes for a good Quatermain...I suppose he did this movie out of his passion for a life close to nature, Though I have to say that the resemblance to Indiana Jones is disturbingly uncanny at times. As for Allison Doody, she obviosuly liked adventure women roles..and she was great as Elsa Schneider in the Indy movie. She does a good job as a partner to Swayze, though of course I have to cringe at some of her silly lines., particularly telling the villains just about anything that comes to her mind. But still, her character avoids the "silly woman whose presence in africa is silly" kind of cliches and she does make Elizabeth Maitkland seem like a fairly strong woman. (Regarding silly women..can anyone be worse than that dreadful Kate Capshaw in indiana movie? I absolutely hated the indiana installment with her as Indy's girlfriend. ) The rest is fine, I suppose, the characters are well-rounded, all in all, though at times you may get the feeling that the whole ensembkle is pointless. Gavin Hood as the antagonist is good too. All in all, I can't say that I haven't enjoyed watching it. Sometimes instead of counting the cliches, it;s better to enjoy the ride as is.

Review: A rather long, 3 hour, movie made for TV by Hallmark. I tend to give this a C to a B grade. Helped by the "Gladiator" like soundtrack and somewhat similar cinematography it moves along pretty well. The movie "Gladiator"-like fight to the death near the end with Swayze and his tribal opponent is laughable as it isn't much of a match and in reality wouldn't have happened, but hey, Swayze has more lives than a cat as do his enemies and the fake russian dialects get tiresome. Finding Soloman's Mine with the ear rings adorned daughter (Doody) forever alongside and spears coming out of the floor pretty much forshadow the final conflict. Pretty typical Hallmark Hall of Fame story, except with considerable violence (shooting of elephants in the begining and escalates to men shooting each other frequently but seriously poor shots, spears into chests). These people are in hot climates, even lots of desert scenes, never sweat even though over dressed in Victorian costuming and lots of gear. They seldom sleep, drink or eat while on foot through plains, desert and mountainous regions. Patrick Swayze does a pretty fair job of being the lead actor. An experienced guide in Africa, he is not an insensive person and practical (esp. about the shooting of elephants who can get pretty revengeful he warns). He is reluctantly returning to Afica to lead a daughter of a professor to save him near fabled King Solomon's mines. But the primary mission of finding the professor being held captive by a tribe gets lost in the shuffle as protecting the prized map to the mines takes priority. After a final shootout between the Russians sent to steal the map, and several deaths along the way, a decent relationship between the lead actress (Doody) and Swayze evolves, especially at the end where he shows interest in her. That relationship was not really cultivated in the film much. There's more mumbo jumbo sometimes in this film than the African dialect shown in subtitle. A bullet being plucked out by hand, the usual obligatory tribal dancing by restless natives, the saving of the professor at the last second by Swayze's gunfire shots in the air, a fight to the death to determine the tribe's king.... all pretty lame stuff. But the map the professor sent to the daughter overseas is a never ending source of grief for the expedition. The Czar's financing of the professor's work leads to his sending russian military types to seek the map and they attack and follow the expedition through the film. There are more than a few shortcuts toward the end which are pretty obvious. Worth watching once, possibly, but not twice, at least for me. Swayze fans will no doubt like him in the film..

Movie name: King Solomon's Mines
Review: Rented this because it stars Swayze as Allan Quatermain, and decided it'd be a nice tribute to him. He's absolutely game here, and the movie surrounding him doesn't bite the big. Not to say it's the best thing ever, but it's better made and more interesting than I would have guessed.

Review: Considering that Patrick Swayze was best well known for his performances as a dancer; such as Dirty Dancing. However, perhaps he would have made a great action hero. This film had everything that made an adventure movie worth watching. Perhaps it had to be one of the best action movies I have seen Swayze ever do.

Review: A lot better than I was expecting. I was anticipating a cheap and cheerful, Indiana Jones-lite, made-for-TV special but it's far more than that with some great characters and beautiful South African scenery. It's a pity that the titular mines didn't have a more prominent role in the story but it's still a classy adventure and as of 2004, Patrick Swayze still looked pretty damn impressive with his shirt off!

Review: I loved this film. I might be a bit biased, seeing as though it is based on one of my favorite novels and I came into it with the preexisting knowledge of the character's backstory, much of which could not be included in the film. With that being said, I thought the film was beautifully executed with some excellent suspense and great moments of tension. The acting was strong and it is a compelling story with interesting themes. I enjoyed it very much.

Review: In many ways the movie is typical melodrama of its era, however George Stevens' direction and the editing are anything but. Also, there's no real moral center of the story which only enhances the tension.

Review: I didn't see this movie till about 10 yrs ago... I cant begin to say how this movie grabbed me.. No idea what it was about, could predict anything I loved the not knowing... Had to stay with it.... What is so amazing, is without all the blood and violence of Today....it was that fear, the suspense that pulled you in... You where there with them on that beach... If you have never been surrounded by a mob, and fear to were you Can't breath....even today, this got me. Elizabeth Taylor....the name alone Says everything....never again such a presence on screen. This film stayed with me for months....MONTGOMERY CLIFT TRULY A GREAT ACTOR.IF HE NEVER SPOKE A WORD, HIS FACE TELLS YOU ALL. IT LEAVES YOU IN A ODD MOOD, BUT I LIKED THAT.

Movie name: A Place in the Sun
Review: Tragic soap opera, stunningly photographed, and well acted by Elizabeth Taylor, and Montgomery Clift. in probably his best performance. Taylor has never looked more beautiful onscreen. Movie's plot fuel are Clift's angst ridden life choices about faithfulness, versus the pursuit of happiness.

Movie name: A Place in the Sun
Review: In 1950, George Eastman (Montgomery Clift), the poor nephew of rich industrialist Charles Eastman, arrives in town following a chance encounter with his uncle while working as a bellhop in Chicago. Although George is regarded as an outsider by the Eastmans, Charles offers George an entry-level job at his factory. George starts dating fellow factory worker Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters) in defiance of the workplace rules. Alice is a poor and inexperienced girl who is dazzled by George and slow to believe that his Eastman name brings him no advantages. Over time, George begins a slow move up the corporate ladder and is invited by Charles to a social event, where George meets and falls for socialite Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor), who is also attracted to him. They fall in love. Just as George enters the intoxicating and care-free lifestyle his new life with Angela brings, Alice announces she is pregnant and, unable to procure an abortion, expects George to marry her. George puts Alice off and continues spending more time with Angela without Alice's knowledge. George is invited to Angela's family lake house over Labor Day and tells Alice the visit will advance his career. Alice discovers George's lie after seeing a newspaper photograph of George and Angela boating with friends. Alice calls George at the Vickers home and threatens to come there and reveal herself unless he leaves and returns to her. Shaken, George tells his hosts his mother is sick and he must leave. The next morning, George and Alice drive to City Hall to get married but it is closed for Labor Day. George is relieved and, remembering Alice cannot swim, begins forming a plan to drown her in the lake by feigning an accident... The film earned an estimated $3.5 million at the U.S. and Canadian box office, and earned critical acclaim in 1951. Upon seeing the film, Charlie Chaplin called it "the greatest movie ever made about America". One impact of the film was from the Edith Head white party dress with its bust covered with flower blossoms worn by Taylor; it was the most popular prom dress style in the U.S. in 1951 and influenced prom and wedding dress design for the rest of the decade. The film's acclaim has not completely held up over time. Reappraisals of the film find that much of what was exciting about the film in 1951 is not as potent in the 21st century. Critics cite the soporific pace, the exaggerated melodrama, and the outdated social commentary as qualities present in A Place in the Sun that are not present in the great films of the era, such as those by Alfred Hitchcock and Elia Kazan, although the performances by Clift, Taylor, and Winters continue to receive praise. (via Wikipedia) "A Place In The Sun" is based on the 1925 novel An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser and the 1926 play, also titled An American Tragedy. It was inspired by the real-life murder of Grace Brown by Chester Gillette in 1906, which resulted in Gillette's conviction and execution by electric chair in 1908. The film was a critical and commercial success, winning six Academy Awards and the first-ever Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama. In 1991, A Place in the Sun was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". This is a wonderful 1951 drama about the great American tragedy with an excellent Montgomery Clift in the lead, a just stunning Elizabeth Taylor and a great Shelley Winters in the other leading roles. This film together with "From here to eternity" shows Montgomery Clift´s magnificent method acting were just his presence says soo much about his character´s emotions. It´s just great to see him own this part as George Eastman. Yes, some things in the film might not feel so potent today as it did back then as mentioned, but that´s not changing the greatness of this film.

Review: Brilliant casting, Able direction, and stellar performances by the leads make this tale of haves and have nots a compelling viewing. While I think Monty Cliff gives a bravado performance I can see Brando as the George character. The only drawback to this classic is that most of the scenes were shot on Hollywood movie sets and not on location. But then it was 1951.

Review: This adaptation of Dreiser's classic novel has excellent production and cinematography and Montgomery Clift delivers a perfect performance, but it falls short on social criticism and casting Winters as an annoying wallflower doesn't help.

Review: My favorite Monty Clift movie. He oozes sexuality here and is about as beautiful a man that has ever appeared on screen. I still find Liz Taylor's legendary beauty a bit baffling - to me she is not remotely in the league of someone like Rita Hayworth or Ava Gardner. But here, I kind of get it. She looks stunning. Their chemistry is superb and you can see why Monty was ready to kill to have her.

Movie name: A Place in the Sun
Review: Raw method acting from 3 of Hollywood's greatest actors. George Steven's romance drama A Place in the Sun (1951) is one of cinema's finest pictures. It captures the romantic aches of being with the one you love as well as the trying frustration of being away from them. Stevens lets you see how greed for money, power, and status within the American Dream can go awry. We witness the consequences in all their dreadful fate bringing. Stevens draws raw and realistic acting from his outstanding cast. Montgomery Clift is fantastic as George Eastman. He pulls off a versatile dramatic role that requires him to extend his range into strange and compelling territory. Clift had to be the charming poor boy with big dreams who romances and seduces Shelley Winters, gets swept off his feet by Elizabeth Taylor, only to also plot a lethal conception too repulsive to say, then portray the guilt ridden consequences of all these emotions and actions. Clift is doing serious method acting here the same year Marlon Brando acts in A Streetcar Named Desire. Both actors are top tier caliber with raw charisma, deep darkness, commanding presence, sensitive personalities, crazed mania, gentle romanticism, and endearing dramatic presence. Clift could do anything. He's jaw dropping during the cute dates and the courtroom testimony sequences alike. Shelley Winters is a true favorite actress of mine and she is simply remarkable in A Place in the Sun as a sensitive, sweet girl next door type named Alice Tripp. She endearingly represents the average girl's dream of meeting a handsome young man who will sweep her off her feet in love, only to have her dreams crushed with the reality that he loves another. Winters is adorable as the nice girl at work with Montgomery Clift, who she has wonderful natural chemistry with in the factory. The lovely and fragile Shelley Winters uses her hurt filled eyes and soft voice with insecure body language to speak volumes. Her heartbreaking and realistic performance should have won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Elizabeth Taylor is certainly pretty as any actress could ever hope to be here as socialite Angela Vickers, but her charming romantic type also leads to real dramatic sympathy as her character endures a lot of heartache as well. Elizabeth Taylor was one of Hollywood's great beauties, but it's always been her realistic and modern acting that feels so natural, that has captivated. She was an excellent actress. Her romantic chemistry is nice and playful with the ever handsome and charming Montgomery Clift. An Ida Lupino favorite actor, Keefe Brasselle, appears as Earl Eastman with his pompous rich arrogance. He's quite believable and versatile compared to his nice guy roles in Lupino's films Not Wanted and Never Fear. Fred Clark's defensive attorney is pretty fun, but it's Raymond Burr's harsh and relentless district attorney that draws you into the suspenseful courtroom drama. Lastly, Ian Wolfe has a fun and memorable cameo as Dr. Wyeland, who Shelley Winters goes to see about an implied abortion consoltation she's begging for to no avail. Stevens keeps you in each believable scenario until you feel the proper despair over the brewing tragedy. William Hornbeck's editing cuts to striking close-ups from revealing wide shots that show us the entire plot through body language. A Place in the Sun is a full 122 minutes, but feels half that length due to the quick pace and convincing method acting. All William C. Mellor's cinematography tells the story through stunning black and white photography. Everything looks compelling with his shots holding on forlorn faces wracked with guilt or longing. George Stevens adapts Theodore Dreiser's novel beautifully with writers Harry Brown and Michael Wilson. Every word carries extra weight about America's loss of innocence, social norms, class difference, wage dynamics, workplace romance, double lives, rich affairs, premarital sex, unwanted children, parental expectations, miserable relationships, infidelity, murder, evading the law, justice, capital punishment, guilt, and courtroom proceedings. It's mature and thoughtful with highly entertaining performances throughout A Place in the Sun. Franz Waxman's score is fittingly romantic with swirls of dreamy melodies for the dates and haunting symphonic accompaniment for all the hard drama. Edith Head's dresses for Shelley Winters are adorable and fit her charming, cozy personality. Head's gowns for Elizabeth Taylor are gorgeous and lavish fitting Taylor's wealthy character perfectly. Wally Westmore's make-up work does up Elizabeth Taylor like a model and Shelley Winters like the sweetest girl next door ever. In all, A Place in the Sun finds the heart of this American capitalist nightmare through the double romance story. All the acting is certainly captivating in every last second of suspense is pulled from this talented cast. A Place in the Sun burns with passion and scathingly scorches the shallow desires of wealth at any cost.

Review: It's the old classic tale, the one night stand that goes wrong and messes up your future plans. Things spiral from there in this classic oldie. Remains a great drama and definitely stands the test of time. One to watch for sure.

Movie name: A Place in the Sun
Review: Attempts to be a sincere take on class structure, ambition, and deceit (a polluted Horatio Alger tale), but instead ends up being a simplistic and naive tragic romance that must be buoyed by traditionally great performances from Clift and Taylor to stay afloat. The runtime could be substantially abridged to more tautly tell the story, and this slow pacing robs any sense of suspense even during the most climactic scenes. While A Place in the Sun may have been a critical darling upon release and a feather in the cap of its more prominent stars, the lack of any profound meaning doesn't create a compelling case decades on. (3/5)

Review: This film is to romance, what Reefer Madness is to marijuana. Its uncomfortable, but really plays out well with a strong ending. Editing is above average for films of it's time.

Movie name: A Place in the Sun
Review: This is one I remember liking a lot when I first saw it; one that doesn't quite hold the same power today. While Montgomery Clift, Shelley Winters and even Elizabeth Taylor are all solid, the film sometimes moves at a glacial pace and the melodrama does get a bit overheated. Facing the issues of class division and sexual yearning, Montgomery Clift is from the black sheep side of a well-to-do family who wants the American Dream of the 1950s: a good job, lots of money and Elizabeth Taylor on his arm. And he could have it, too, if it was not for his embarrassing, ultra-religious mother, and his own lower-class impulses. This is the uniquely American Tragedy: his identity is the very thing that prevents him from attaining what he desires. An interesting look at the manners and mores of the 1950s, whose lack of subtlety renders it a less than heartfelt tragedy. Raymond Burr plays the district attorney here, just a few years before he would switch sides and become a defense lawyer in "Perry Mason."

Movie name: A Place in the Sun
Review: One of two overrated George Stevens melodramas produced in the 1950s that have not aged well despite all of their supposedly high minded ideas. Fortunately this film is considerably shorter than the equally ponderous Giant (1956) at a tidy two hours and a two minutes but it still feels like a slog. I can say that this is one of the few films that I hated that contained a performance that I absolutely loved as Shelley Winters is able to escape the horror of the rest of the film and craft a fascinating character with depth not found in the other performances. It is difficult to see why Stevens won Best Director for his work on this film when Elia Kazan, William Wyler and John Huston produced some of the best work of their careers in films that have held up to modern scrutiny. The poor George Eastman, Montgomery Clift, sees a chance to move up in the world when he obtains a job at the company of his wealthy, upper class uncle Charles, Herbert Heyes, who looks down on him. He falls in love with his equally poor co-worker Alice Tripp, Shelley Winters, and seduces her into having sex with him resulting in an unwanted pregnancy. Meanwhile he is able to earn a promotion and is enamored of the wealthy Angela Vickers, Elizabeth Taylor, who he begins seeing without Tripp's knowledge. Tripp wants to marry and move away but Eastman attempts to divert her while romancing Vickers who becomes more receptive to his affections. He is eventually accepted by Vickers and her family and becomes engaged to her but he believes that in order to pursue a romance with her he must kill Tripp. He changes his mind at the last minute but Tripp accidentally drowns and he is arrested for murder. The film intends to be an indictment of the class system, or at least the book it was based on is, as Eastman is driven to do terrible things due to his desire to move into a higher social class. This message is all but discarded in the film as it turns into a classic tale of rooting for two attractive people to get together while not considering the feelings of the slightly less attractive third wheel who is the only morally decent person in the film. Stevens opts to make this a full on love story as he spends his time ogling Taylor while presenting Winters in the darkness and trying to convince the audience that she is shrill and unlikable. I was never convinced and I was often disgusted by the fact that the film prefers a docile, childlike woman who is valued mainly for her physical attractiveness to an assertive woman with ambitions of her own who has never been seen as simply a sex object. It is a testament to the phenomenally talented Winters who was at the height of her powers here that she gives Tripp layers and makes her character's progression believe despite uneven writing. In the opening scenes she conveys a wonderful sense of shyness that is overcome only due to her painful loneliness as she is at once uncertain and over eager in her interactions with Eastman. She seems positively girlish in these moments without giving up any of the fierce wit and intelligence that Winters was known for. The scene in which she is angrily turned away by a doctor is heartbreaking and she has the good sense to play it with restraint as she doesn't devolve into the fireworks that other actresses of this era would have fallen prey to. With the sudden turn of her character from sympathetic heroine to annoying, nagging shrew, in the eyes of the filmmakers at least, she continues to be the stable, grounded force in the film, much like Kim Hunter in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951). She is utterly unforgettable and adds complexity to a character who turns into an all out villain in the hands of the screenwriter and director Stevens but is really a flawed, sensitive and achingly sympathetic young woman. When Winters is not on screen the quality of the film plummets as Clift is tasked with an impossible role and doesn't make the nonsensical choices that the character makes understandable. He has that intense gaze and you get the sense that he is really "committed" to this role but on his own he is a crashing bore and his lack of chemistry with Taylor does not help matters. Taylor is her usually vacuous self in a role that could use some layering as I suspect that Vickers did not truly love George but was only interested in him momentarily. Taylor brings none of this to the role and uses her high pitched, breathy voice to excruciating effect as all she seems to do is announce that she is happy to see Eastman. The pair are two of the dullest romantic partners I have witnessed in a long time and I will remember Winters long after they have evaporated from my mind.

Movie name: An American in Paris
Review: An American in Paris is a typical mid-century musical about love, misunderstandings and dancing. No one will deny that Gene Kelly was the best dancer of his generation. However, his character in AAP was absolutely unrelatable with his obnoxious attitude and air of self-importance. The supporting characters were either one-dimension or just as annoying as the lead. Gene Kelly never should have gotten the girl. What he should have gotten is a good kick in the behind and a lesson in manners. The paper thin plot and writing did not do this musical any favors. Not recommended

Review: One of the greatest musicals ever, "An American in Paris" is Vincente Minnelli's magnum opus.

Movie name: An American in Paris
Review: An American in Paris is a movie that's feather-light on story, but classical in all the right ways. The story centers around Jerry, a war veteran (Gene Kelly) who wants to make a career as a painter in the City of Lights. Also roped in are an heiress (Nina Foch) who wants to sell his paintings, Adam (Oscar Levant) who wants to become a pianist, and Lise (Leslie Caron) who Jerry falls in love with. Being a jukebox musical with cinema's greatest dancer and choreographer, it's incredibly clear that story isn't its strength. Instead, much like Going My Way, the film is tailor made to show off Mr. Kelly's talent. However, what makes An American in Paris stand out is the vibrant mise en scene by Vincente Minnelli. I especially love the 17-minute climax near the end, where Jerry and Lise dance romantically around colorful cardboard sets and change from one wardrobe to another. The high kinetic energy and outrageous chemistry between the two makes the scene more believable and lures you to celebrate their merriment. With that said, An American in Paris is my favorite Gene Kelly movie, granted I've only seen three of his films. I love the music, the atmosphere, the sets, the costumes, and also how far it goes just for a simple story. (4 ½ Jerry Mulligan Paintings out of 5)

Review: The mid-century obsession with predictable plots and one-dimensional characters is no better represented than in An American in Paris ... up to the last 20 or so minutes, which are such an entertaining, beautifully composed, and lively exhibition of music and dance that it almost makes up for the rest of the film hanging like a stone around its neck. Levant's dry wit provides some compensation for the shortcomings of the narrative segment, but it's not enough to bring the entire film up to par. (3.5/5)

Movie name: An American in Paris
Review: An American in Paris won the Best Picture Oscar in 1952. Twelve years after Gone with the Wind, it would be the second color film to earn that award. And it wasted not a single moment showing off the fullest palette of color possible, with splendid results. The film is a musical that hearkens back to the days of the big old Hollywood Studio System. If you are looking for a deep plot forget it! In fact, the plot is so thin that the movie requires two lavish dream sequences in order to beef up the screen time for the viewer. In a nut shell, Gene Kelly, plays Jerry, an American living in Paris as a struggling painter. He is friends with Adam (Oscar Levant), a struggling musician. They are both friends with Henri, a night club performer. A rich woman named Nina takes an interest in Jerry's art, and in Jerry himself. However, Jerry takes interest in another woman named Lise (Leslie Caron). Jerry stalks Lise and ignores her requests to leave her alone (as men did in the 50's!), so she of course falls in love with him. The problem is that she is engaged to his friend Henri. Though Jerry is good friends with Henri, he somehow was never introduced to Lise, prior to meeting her in a nightclub. That's about it! I'm pretty sure I don't need to tell you who Lise will end up with in the end! This movie is all about the spectacle, dance, and musical numbers. And if those are things you enjoy, then you should thoroughly love this movie. I have to say that I found the use of imagery and split screen much more reminiscent of the late 50's or early 60's, so I think that is a testament to director Vincent Minelli being ahead of his time. The one dream sequence where Oscar Levant imagines himself not only directing an orchestra, but being every single orchestra member as well, was a particular stand out. This is a musical-lover's musical. The dancing is top notch (Kelly and Caron are a wonderful pair, and their final quarter-hour routine is a masterpiece) and the old George Gershwin numbers are reminders of wonderful days gone by. This was pure escapism at its very best. For those who are connoisseurs of iconic television, it's also nice to see small cameo appearances by Noel Neill (Lois Lane from the 1950's Adventures of Superman), Madge Blake (Aunt Harriett from the 1960's Batman) and Hayden Rorke (Major Bellows from the 1960's I Dream of Jeannie)!

Review: It's a great looking film. The camera work through the city and the start as it moves up to Genes window is well done. From the sets, colours and terrific cinematography. The look of Paris is hard to fault, it's very vivid and plays well with Gene Kelly as an artist. You can understand it's technical Oscar and why it didn't win for acting. Leslie Caron impresses when she dances but is only ok when acting. They are some good songs and dance sequences with a a very thin plot with the love triangle and a rich girl who takes chances on Genes talent. There are better musicals out there and more deserving films that should have won best picture. Gene Kelly is as always likeable, though I found his pursuit of the young women a little cringy. I got rhythm is a nice number with the children and the constant top tapping does get a little tiresome throughout the film. The 17 minute dance sequence starting from pencil drawings through bright colours to a huge crescendo, is great if a little long. 6 for plot and acting, 8 for the production, songs and dances.

Review: The Oscar for Best Picture? A debatable winner in a relatively weak field where the year's best film (Hitchcock's) wasn't even nominated. The Oscar for Gene Kelly? Utterly undeniable, like Kelly's talent itself. Oscar Levant? "It's not a pretty face, I grant you but underneath its flabby exterior is an enormous lack of character." — His delivery is somehow even better than his playing.

Review: Worst kind of musical -- no story, no plotline, weak characters with a lot of 1930s style vaudevillian "dance" numbers. Bad in its day, but grows weaker and less relevant with each passing year. A clunker that is wildly overrated.

Review: The reviews of this movie are mixed, and there is a reason behind this. On the one hand it counts as one of the greats that were made about Hollywood and moviemaking, such as Sunset Boulevard, All About Eve, Paris When It Sizzles, and others. On the other hand, it seems too dry and formal. The plot is hollow that 90 minutes would suffice, but with the slow pacing the movie extends to a little less than 2 hours, rendering it tedious. The only thing that would compensate is the cast, but even that falls short to a childish dialogue and acting that looks staged. What Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) says in The Bad and the Beautiful applies to the movie itself: "You're acting now, playing the doomed daughter of the great man. Well, let me tell you something. The acting isn't good enough."

Movie name: The Bad and the Beautiful
Review: Pure drivel. There are only two reasons to watch this: Lana Turner and Gloria Grahame. Is the acting that bad, or is it the script?

Movie name: The Bad and the Beautiful
Review: The Bad and the Beautiful is a film that is easy to have conflicting feelings for. On the one hand, it's a great performance from Douglas as he goes through a Citizen Kane-like rise and fall (but in the movie industry during the Golden Age), while on the other, the film doesn't feel like it carries any real narrative heft and lacks much in the way of complexity. The film is told through a series of three vignettes of individuals that Douglas' Shields variously wronged to further his own ends, seemingly taking a stance on the dark personalities that succeed in the industry. However, not only do all three find success after his betrayal (and not as a result of some convoluted plan from Shields, like his assistant implies), but they all end up willing to assist him later on when the chips are down on his end, as if they exist in some Candyland fairytale in which Shields somehow allowed them to grow through adversity when in reality he simply took advantage of each of them. The film is well structured, establishing the animosity of its trio wordlessly and creating a sense of curiosity as to how these seemingly refined people could be led to do something as crude as graffiti in a major Hollywood studio, before turning the tables and creating a sense of empathy for each. But the plot and ultimate theme leaves you scratching your head, wondering if the critical love isn't due in part to the heavy focus on the film industry and the seemingly automatic bump in esteem that comes from critics recognizing their own playground. (3/5)

Review: If you're a Fan Of Classic Cinema, this one is an Absolute Must-See! Kirk Douglas's vain jackass of a Hollywood Film Director is a sight to behold! And both Lana Turner and Gloria Grahame practically steal the show!

Movie name: The Bad and the Beautiful
Review: It could have been darker. Nevertheless it turned out to be much more glamorous than any other Vincent Minnelli musical. The dialogues are weak even if the story as a whole is gripping. At times I feel it sappy and unoriginal. Maybe it's because I'm putting it next to "Sunset Boulevard"; a major achievement in Hollywood's history. It is however an entertaining movie despite the melodramatic scenes.

Review: Another great film about the Hollywood film industry released in the early 50s.

Movie name: The Bad and the Beautiful
Review: An unscrupulous movie producer uses an actress, a director and a writer to achieve success. This film shows via flashback the stories of three famous movie people whose lives were forever changed by their association with a manipulative, ruthless movie producer. The three come together at the producer's request; he wants them to work together on mutually hated Jonathon Shields' newest big-budget production Stars: Lana Turner, Kirk Douglas, Walter Pidgeon, Dick Powell, Gloria Grahame . The Bad and the Beautiful took home a quintet of Oscars from 1953's ceremony and in its title alone we have possibly the greatest ever description of Hollywood. Gloria Grahame won an Oscar . Best Actress in a Supporting Role . Kirk Douglas shows here what a unique and powerful actor he really is and Lana Turner also shines as the gorgeous looking actress and Shields love interest. Bottom line, when it comes to movies about movies, this one remains the best more than 50 years after it's initial release. Highly recommended 10/10.

Review: About as good as a movie can get. ignoring all the star power in this one, major props must be given to the script/subject matter itself. an adult story that is interesting:? maybe you could do that in 1953, but in the twenty-first century, teenage boys decide the vast majority of movie content. a movie like this could never be made. for this and many other reasons, this movie was a thrill and a revelation to watch.

He plays a highly ambitious and talented movie producer whose ambition has destroyed relations with people close to him. Three of those people - an actor, director and writer - recall his betrayals. Fine film that Hollywood fans might enjoy more if they research who the characters were based on.

Movie name: The Quiet Man
Review: Aunque en ocasiones adopta un tono más serio, 'El hombre tranquilo' se presenta como una comedia romántica que se fundamenta en el choque de culturas, personajes arquetípicos y la búsqueda del amor imposible tan característica del Hollywood de la época, todo ello bajo el estilo distintivo de John Ford. A pesar de las actitudes reiterativas de los personajes (especialmente de Maureen O'Hara) que pueden restar dinamismo a la trama, y de las exageraciones típicas de producciones de este tipo, así como de un posible envejecimiento desfavorable en algunos aspectos, la película resulta ser bastante entretenida y divertida. Destacan las actuaciones magistrales, en especial la de Maureen O'Hara, quien llegó a afirmar que esta era su mejor interpretación en el cine. El elenco en su conjunto aporta un carácter entrañable a la película, y el desarrollo argumental logra convertir una trama recurrente en algo particular, fresco y digno de ser reseñado.

Review: The Quiet Man made a big splash when it came out, but maybe that's because 1952 wasn't a great year for films. I mean, The Greatest Show on Earth won Best Picture that year. This movie is amusing enough. It was interesting to see John Wayne in a movie that had nothing to do with war or the wild west. However, my big issue with this movie was the relationship between Sean (Wayne) and Mary (Maureen O'Hara). Aside from her being pretty, I couldn't see why Sean was interested in Mary, and based on how he treated her, I didn't see why Mary wanted to be with Sean. The Quiet Man hasn't aged well, I guess.

Review: What really gets me is anyone not liking this movie. You have to be a complete snob or a hateful person. To quote another John Wayne movie, "you have no milk of human kindness" to not love this film. This movie should be at 99%-100%. John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara have got that "go together" quality that few stars had on the screen.

Review: All Time Classic. The real star here is the incredible cinematography. It's not hyperbole to state this is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It truly is jaw dropping. The music matches and gives this such a charming catchy identity throughout as well. The acting is excellent and hats off to Wayne for really playing a charming, stern, but humble character that doesn't have many lines but speaks with his great actions and expressions which truly surprised me. Anyone who says Wayne can't play anyone but a tough cowboy I refer them here. Everyone else is excellent and likeable and charming. But the standout as excellent as Wayne is, is O'Hara. She is amazing in this and has amazing chemistry with Wayne and her beauty matches the setting. If it isn't the setting of Ireland making this pop its O'Hara. There really isn't many other stars I can think of who can electrify the screen like her in this. This is a very well paced film that does take its time but always gives you something to enjoy while it moves along cinematography wise or acting wise and it pays off with a awesome and fun fight that doesn't disappoint. The editing is masterful also and moves between Sean/Mary-Kate without missing a beat and has lots of underlying commentary about family cultures and love that I didn't expect. This is a lot of fun and even in slower moments your never bored. The only minor issue is the accents did get in the way so I turned on subtitles which fixed it instantly. This is something everyone should see once.

Review: A true classic but not perfect. There are some minor character issues. But my main issue is the length. Considering the plot there was no need for it to be over 2 hours. There are several things that could have been trimmed or cut entirely and it wouldn't have affected the story whatsoever. I think a tight 90 to 100 minute runtime would be perfect. But because of it being so long, it can drag. But not enough to ruin it. I mean it when I say a true classic and even with the draggy pace. It's still a classic.

Review: Pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. Montgomery Cliff and Burt Lancaster are really great as soldiers in the Army before WWII. The romantic scenes left me cold. As they usually do with movies from the 1950's. The complete lack of intimacy. But I did love the scenes with the soldiers.

Review: Iconic beach make-out sequences and good performances aside, the movie has so many noticeable compromises and cop outs in adapting its source material that it lessens the film's potential emotional impact.

Movie name: From Here to Eternity
Review: The casting in this movie is excellent and the actors do an excellent job with what they're given, but there wasn't enough for me to invest in these characters relationships or characters. I can tell there is depth to these characters, no doubt form the book, but the movie didn't delve into it and I had trouble believing in their short-lived, fairly under-developed relationships - particularly the romances. I think the iconic beach scene is incredibly well-done and obviously pushing the envelope for it's time, but I have trouble stomaching the sense that Kerr's character has to excuse her affairs, much less that they can only be excused by serious trauma - not a lesson I can get behind.

Movie name: From Here to Eternity
Review: A Classic Drama. Pretty much everything about this is fundamentally really well made. The only issues are the music is good when used but like most Zimmerman pictures it is very seldom used here but it never really feels dry here compared to other movies he's made mainly because it's very well paced with good drama and romance in between that never feels like it's dragged out or a slow burn. The setting is very memorable, there is excellent camerawork, and the attack is very well done also with a great mixture of stock footage and practical effects that blends in perfectly. It's very hard to tell what stock actually is. The editing is very good also but it can jump between Clift & Lancasters story a bit in the first half and it can feel a little jumpy but it really isn't that big a deal mainly because of how well acted and shot everything is. It's very impressive how not much happens here but it never feels like stuff just happens.It does a great job building charming, likable, complex characters that you care about male & female. The ending was a surprise also. Anyone who is a fan of any actors in this, the director, or drama/war hybrid films (As this really isn't a war movie or a straight drama) will like this a lot.

Review: This is one of those movies that I find difficult to change the channel every time it's on. It's a little shy in depicting the brothel scenes, otherwise the ensemble cast is irresistible.

Review: I completely agree with ed m. I am a huge fan of Fred Zinnemann, but unlike High Noon, From Here to Eternity does not hold up well. The plot's soap opera elements drag it down despite some good performances...and some not as good as we'd like to pretend they are. I'm talking to you, Frank. If you still think that this is a classic, invite some friends under 65 to come watch it. When "The End" flashes on the screen, you will be alone.

Review: top 10 all time film a must must must see

Movie name: From Here to Eternity
Review: As classics (i.e. black and white films pre-1960s), I quite like this one as it has a good cast (Burt Lancaster and Frank Sinatra), interesting characters and some intriguing scenarios. There's some quite witty dialogue ('if you carry on drinking, you'll be as much use as a melted candle' etc.) and I found it to be an enjoyable watch for the most part. I suppose the plot partly reminded me of the recent drama series 'Catch-20'. I don't tend to be especially keen on some black and white older films but this one was enjoyable with the banter sort of aspect, the various male characters trying to out-do one another, the one-upmanship aspect and so on. Speaking of that, I was almost surprised by how open the male characters are, when talking to the females. I also liked that the female characters were quite good at standing up for themselves too, as necessary at different times. I suppose its perhaps a little sentimental but not entirely in a bad way. Oh and the bugle playing is pretty impressive!. I can certainly see why this is regarded as a classic film, with quite solid performances - its a fairly solid watch which I'd recommend.

Movie name: From Here to Eternity
Review: It's a very good film with strong performances and some great cinematic passion, I just can't see myself seeing it again, though.

Movie name: From Here to Eternity
Review: The movie follows a proud solider trapped in the dilemma of his unrelenting devotion to the military and the rigors at a corrupt military base in Hawaii he's been transferred to. The story leading up to the day of Infamy explores the abusive aspects of military cultures and the ideas of unreciprocated love and unappreciated dedication. It is candidly incredible how the internal conflicts the protagonist must wrestle with and the well crafted compelling story and characters of this movie still resonate with and speak to us more than 70 years after its release. It's a criminally underrated cinematic masterpiece.

Movie name: From Here to Eternity
Review: Some movies you only care to watch once. Conversely, others you can watch over and over and never get tired of the story line. This is one of those movies. A star studded cast and superbly directed this movie is a perfect production. The producer certainly knew his business. One of the great movies of the 1950's. Seventy years old but still ever fresh. Be sure not to miss.

Movie name: From Here to Eternity
Review: It was on TCM's playlist and it's one of those iconic American films which I hadn't seen before. I can see why audiences went for this the year I was born - it pushed a lot of hot buttons in the immediate post-war era. It's a pot boiler but limited by the Hollywood production code still in effect. The crashing surf serving as a proxy for the passion between Lancaster and Kerr is a nice period touch. It's hard to separate the performances of the various cast members from their roles and the shooting script. Do we think Burt was especially good in this, or did he get the most sympathetic part? As for Clift, I've given up trying to figure out why critics and film historians think he's so noteworthy; I saw him doing the same portrayal in this as he did in Hitchcock's "I Confess." A lot of the movie revolves around his character but I couldn't see his motivation for undergoing "the treatment" at all. Another "production code" flaw is Donna Reed's involvement with him. I would guess this was developed a lot more in a 900 page book than it was here, but why she did a One Eighty on her life plan for a buck private showing little out of the ordinary escaped me. Women of any kind were a scarce commodity anywhere near a US military base in Hawaii at that time; the lines outside Honolulu's brothels on Hotel Street stretched around the block on paydays and the "New Congress Club" is a laughably sanitized version of what soldiers and sailors went downtown for. In accordance with movie-making of the time, Ernest Borgnine's character gets what's coming to him and December 7th provides a convenient wrapup for the multiple plot threads. Overall an acceptable watch but not All That and a Bag of Chips.

Movie name: From Here to Eternity
Review: I gave this so called time classic the very benefit of the doubt as it deserves and my undivided attention for the 2 hrs and 5 mins running time to not feel all that entertained at the very end. Was my 1st time viewing ever and I tried hard to think like they did back in 1953 but that still did not work. Just too much love interest, flirting and "kissy kissy" even for 1953. The last 20 mins was long awaited for as Pearl Harbor was attacked and there was some half decent fight action finally but it was short lived and came too late in the movie. Talk about build up to the max and then just to see one of the main actors just die so easily before the end credits. I felt this was quite weak even for 1953 and the audience back then. If you have not yet seen Eternity like me today for whatever reason...try Tora Tora Tora, Bridge on the River Kwai and Midway rather instead. The acting performances were good overall in Eternity by Lancaster and Sinatra and Borgnine, etc, but it just lacked action and flare and just way too much build up. I had to pause and take a 20 min. cat nap half way through. 2.5 stars of 5!

Movie name: From Here to Eternity
Review: Beautifully conducted with remarkable performances and a story that keeps getting better and better. A true masterpiece elevated by Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster at their prime. It's a fine example that emotions and expressions have more value than words.

Movie name: From Here to Eternity
Review: Tonally all over the place despite some sincere acting. Fred Zinnemann's romantic war drama (1953) is engaging despite being very scattershot in terms of tonal consistency. Zinnemann's direction is striking with his realistic depiction of military hazing, but the romance drama stuff is really scarce here. For everyone talking about the amazing beach scene, which is like a minute long lovely romantic feeling, then turns into an argument, From Here to Eternity is pretty focused on how awful military life is at its heart. Zinnemann tried to do too much as you will go from a cute date, to a man getting beat up, then Pearl Harbor is getting bombed. It's really jarring and not emotionally gripping like it should be, honestly. From Here to Eternity has some good acting, but the script has not aged well. Montgomery Clift is awesome in From Here to Eternity as a tough new recruit, who gets hazed. His nuanced acting alongside Donna Reed feels real and genuine in every moment they are on screen. Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr are nice together, but awkwardly stilted with the strangely dated script. Everything romantic feels accusatory. Frank Sinatra is terrible. He's not funny as the playful sidekick who stands by Montgomery Clift. He doesn't make you laugh or smile as he's just an angry drunk. Ernest Borgnine is scary as the cruel stockade warden and a horrible racist in From Here to Eternity. It's hard to care about Sinatra's character arc when he is so unlikable. His acting is embarrassing and never feels authentic, especially compared Burt Lancaster or Montgomery Clift. In all, you could watch it for some nice romantic scenes, but From Here to Eternity is more concerned about social commentary about military protocol.

Movie name: From Here to Eternity
Review: A well-made if not sanitized adaptation of the novel. I found it interesting that the famous ocean sweeping the lovers as they make-out scene is just an incidental set-up shot, and not even a major moment in the story. While Frank Sinatra is definitely a scene-stealer, everyone turns in a solid performance.

Movie name: Shane
Review: Admittedly it does lose points for having one of the most annoying children in film history, Shane often appears on many lists of best westerns and often rightly so. It's a beautiful tale about the necessary pacifism of a developed civilisation and the violence upon the back on which its peace was won. It's tragic in its irony as Shane himself is the portrait of the kind of man that was necessary to win the peace but who society cannot permit to stay and enjoy it, gunshots as loud as cannons making that plain as day. Too good to be evil and too evil to be good. Presented to us through the eyes of an adoring child and this picture of a man who wants to be something he isn't. It's not a film trying to show us what the Wild West was really like but to be a perfect example of what America wanted it to be like.

Review: Shane, come back! Awesome film. Not only is Alan Ladd great as the lead, the supporting cast manages to shine in their own way. You really manage to feel that each person has their own little life in the small Western town. So when one of the characters is killed off by the town roughnecks, you really feel for him even if he is a minor character. Bringing in Jack Palance so late into the film as a sort of diabolus ex machina was a strange, but well-done choice so that they could have a good showdown for the end; this is necessary because the roughnecks are beaten up in a brawl by Shane and Company. There is also some depth to Shane's departure at the end that is great in itself. We can detect the hint of a spark between him and the homesteader's wife, so by skipping town, it helps keep his decent character maintained. We also can't help but wonder what he is running away from, but the mystique is better than some unnecessary flashback that may have ruined the film's excellent pacing.

Movie name: Shane
Review: Writer-director George Stevens makes one of the most influential westerns Jack Palance is the only player I'm familiar with here This focuses on a weary gunfighter in 1880s Wyoming His name is Shane played by the late Alan Ladd and he envisions living a quiet life after befriending a family in the countryside He also develops a bond with the boy Joey played by Brandon de Wilde who sees him as an idol, Shane becomes this family's homesteader But trouble comes in the form of a range war from some cattlers using intimidation tactics It's a fight between the townsfolk and ruthless cattle barons as Shane must protect them at all costs There's no living with the killing, sometimes you can't escape a brand that sticks and you can't break a mould, a man has to be what he is, a gun is a tool no better or worse than any man who uses it, some actions have no redemption Gorgeous vistas of the Wyoming landscapes, great performances all around yet it's very light on the action and gunplay Yet this did have an influence on other movies and tv later on even most recent with Logan starring Hugh Jackman with substantial themes It all surrounds the moral codes of the lonely American outlaw, running from destiny, and escaping a life of killing taking a toll on one's soul A classic even if it lags in areas but an example of what America wanted the Wild West to be for everyone plus it breaks typical traditional tropes of this genre

Movie name: Shane
Review: A Western Classic. The cinematography is phenomenal with memorable locations and a beautiful setting along with memorable sweeping music. The acting is very well done. The only problem is sometimes the stoic acting can come across as wooden and stilted but there is more than enough chemistry between everyone. The Land Baron Villain is kind of forgettable but Wilson is a good menacing henchman. The editing is good and overall its well paced but has a problem about an hour in. The first half is very well done and builds quite well despite the slow pacing buildup to the halfway point. However, the first 30 minutes of the 2nd half really slow things down as we focus on the settlers and Shane is just kind of forgotten in the background and the Father becomes the main character. It feels like this part should've been in the first half of the film instead and some of the slower moments of the first cut out. This is a very slow film because there isn't much conflict between anyone aside from the Land Barons through most of the runtime and than it feels like stuff just happens for 30 minutes in the second half really makes this slow and hurts the pacing significantly. There isn't much action aside from the fist fight in the middle. However, the ending is so sentimental, moving, and iconic that it makes up for the structural pacing issues of the second half and makes you forget all about it. This is a must see for any western fan, Classic Hollywood or George Steven's fan.

Review: Classic Western tells a simple tale of good against bad with its title figure representing a subdued, mysterious kind of superhero, played by Alan Ladd in a similar tight-lipped fashion as in his Noir dramas (and Jack Palance the convincing counter villain to his character); beautifully staged and photographed within a palpable geographic setting and with superb performances.

Review: 97% from the red round people, wow, did I miss something when I watched this film, it's corny, stiff at times, over acted and the pretend horse riding scenes make you laugh, it's not a flop by any means but 3% from being perfect, I don't think so. It's nearer 73% I reckon, if you have not seen Shane which cave have you been living in, it's a rite of passage for any movie-maniac, a must-see film to gauge other westerns by. Alan Ladd is a fine actor, but every time I see one of his films my mind drifts back to the sentimental clap trap that spoils Shane, it's not all sentimental clap trap but any is too much for me,

Movie name: Shane
Review: This is a one of a kind Western because there has never been a Cowboy quite like Shane. The mystery of his past are never revealed but the underlining sadness in his eyes and the kindness of his heart speak volumes. Jack Palance as the town Villain also excelled in his role. Heartfelt moments between the devotion of a homesteaders family to their heritage and land are unsurpassed. Shane not only gives hope to the oppressed town folks but succeeds to protect them from the Greed Driven Ranchers. Its a Western that has everything one could want not to mention the most picturesque landscape that stands out above all others.

Movie name: Shane
Review: In "Shane," one of the greatest of all westerns, we get a portrait of life on the frontier like no other in the genre, replete with a rustic feel of authenticity and a breathtaking purity that creates a truly cleansing experience for the soul. The film is characterized by a sublime combination of the grandest mountain vistas and a quietly understated depiction of human relationships and conflict; we feel as though we are experiencing a take on the Western that is, on the one hand, uncannily true to the spirit of the genre while on the other hand equally true to itself as its own standalone cinematic statement. The title character beguiles us with his sense of guarded mystery, creating a fascinating puzzle that we are more than happy to endlessly ponder without ever hoping for a conclusive solution. "Shane" is a work that touches the heart and generates a feeling of deep yearning for a way of life that is long gone but able to ever linger as a shadow in the collective memory.

Movie name: Shane
Review: A brilliant and heartfelt Western about the will to persevere. Director George Stevens' Western drama Shane (1953) ushers in hopeful optimism for Americana and fresh bloody violence for the Western genre at large. You feel how the farmers can still live on, while the opposing land thieves have to be gunned down in order for peace to reign. Steven's direction is gripping and fascinating. He wanted visceral violence with sound designers Harry Lindgren and Gene Garvin creating gunshot noises to thunder like cannon blasts to shock the audience. Visual effects artists Gordon Jennings and Farciot Edouart show bursts of searing red blood and violently pull men getting shot or punched across rooms. Simultaneously, Stevens keeps a tender and personable dramatic manner to Shane. Stevens reinvents the Western with Shane. Writers Jack Schaefer and A.B. Guthrie Jr. created Shane's iconic wisdom about being a man, learning how to quickdraw, and when a man should resort to shooting. This is a lot of great life advice throughout Shane about the courage necessary in order to keep living during our hardest moments and persevering against adversity. I love the ruthless brutality, defeated pragmatism, and hopeful optimism demonstrated throughout Shane by various characters. Shane feels like the first raw and honest Western, marking a grittier and more violent turn for Westerns. Alan Ladd has a calming and measured manner to him as Western gunslinger Shane. He brawls with a scrappy style when necessary and his finale quickdraw is as cool as any the Western genre has come up with, but it is Ladd's natural feeling performance that is magnetic. His every word of wisdom and kindness feels all the more poignant by virtue of Alan Ladd's relaxed confidence and earnest personality. He feels both nice and dangerous for a complex Western hero that John Wayne rarely could match. He embodies the do-gooder heart of many of Clint Eastwood's Western heroes without the selfish greed. Jean Arthur is convincing as the concerned and disapproving of violence mother Marian Starrett. Van Heflin's resilient farmer Joe Starrett seems a good man, even if he's foolish in how he handles his oppressors. Brandon De Wilde is a cute kid as Joey Starrett, who you understand his naive love of Shane and masculine admiration for Shane's cool heroism. Jack Palance's grinning menace is creepy as villainous gunfighter Jack Wilson. Palance delights in violence and revels as he murders with every big smile. Elisha Cook Jr. is brave, if gullible, as touchy farmer Frank "Stonewall" Torrey. Editors William Hornbeck and Tom McAdoo keep Shane's story moving for a steady 118 minutes that doesn't bore me. I found Shane to be a nice slow burn that explodes into sudden violence for excitement and shocks. Their smooth cuts from scenic pastoral vistas to hardened characters mourning their land and friends are striking. Cinematographer Loyal Griggs uses every inch of screen for gorgeous mountain views and brilliant Technicolor. Shane still looks vibrant and lush half a century later. Hal Pereira and Walter H. Tyler's art direction focuses on natural rivers and mountain valleys for an enclosed area away from society, yet vast in its pretty environment. Emile Kuri's sparse sets look like real shops, saloons, and farmhouses. The all wooden buildings and furnishings appear realistic. Composer Victor Young's sweeping melodic score for Shane is lovely. Every scene has a serene feel until the boisterous orchestra chimes in with Victor Young's lightning score. His tempo changes and tranquil melodies really soar above Shane's shining warmth for atmosphere. Edith Head's costumes are all practical and gritty with a bit of fitted style for these cowhands and gunslingers. Wally Westmore's make-up is naturalistic and dirty for realism. In short, Shane proves bravery is the path for men to walk down, while knowing when to not fight is also a virtue.

Review: With the influence of the countless films that followed, the film's impact on cinema is undeniable, the social commentary of corruption, betrayal, and redemption is ever so effective, in addition to Brando's tour de force of a performance, <i>On the Waterfront</i> is much more than just the regular crime drama.

Review: A masterpiece about dockside corruption and intimidation and what it does to its victims. Any review of this film will tell you that Marlon Brando's performance was game changing for the film industry and I can see why - anguished, inarticulate, often looking somewhere away from the action - it feels like he's in a different film from the rest of the characters, but somehow he connects all the same. Brando is fascinating every minute he's on the screen but all the cast are terrific, especially Karl Malden, whose priest burns with righteous anger, and Eva Marie Saint, winning an Oscar in her film debut. Lee J Cobb (the chief villain) could have carried the film on his own, but with a film this good, he's surrounded by talent. There's a real ex-boxer turned actor in here, too - Tony Galento - very appropriate.

Movie name: On the Waterfront
Review: A heartfelt tale of bravery, perseverance and being your own man on the docks of New Jersey! Marlon Brando brings vulnerability and charisma to his portrayal of a low-level boxer who can't seem to find hope in his dismal lifestyle. However, he soon finds the strength to stand up for himself and his community as he takes on the gangsters controlling the town!

Review: Not only is this considered one of Marlon Brando's best performances, but it is also one of the greatest movies ever made! In addition to being a powerful, hardy, and brutally violent movie, "On the Waterfront" should go down in theater history as influential, because it is based on undeniable truth and audiences will be particularly affected by it.

Review: What makes On the Waterfront great? It has such a compelling story about corruption and moral dilemmas. It also has the greatest actor of all time Marlon Brando plus a Director that pushed the boundaries of cinema like Elia Kazan. The film is also filled with a great supporting cast who raised their level of acting because of Brando. All of this made On the Waterfront one of the most iconic, influential and quotable American films ever made. Marlon Brando changed acting forever with his craft shattering performances in the early to mid 1950's. This movie has one of Brando's great performances that raised the bar and became a part of the legendary fabric of Hollywood cinema. This film is everything a film should be and is why I love classic movies.

Review: Terry Mallory runs errands for Johnny Friendly who is a gang lord and is involved in illegal activities. He meets the sister of a man who was killed by Johnny's man and decides to revolt against him. Man what a movie this was, it literally has it all! Every single performance in this movie is remarkable, iconic and everything you seek for in a performance, I couldn't have asked for a better ensemble of performances. The movie looks absolutely gorgeous in black and white, the framing is on point and the score is shining on the background, there is just something about scores around the 60s, I just love them. On the Waterfront feels almost like a West Side Story, but with a twist. I just love the way that Elia Kazan build the whole Waterfront from the beginning, towards the end, you really feel like you have lived there at some point in your life. On the Waterfront has one of the strongest 3rd acts of all time, it literally couldn't have been better. Sure you have the feeling that you have seen this movie before in some way, but it still manages to give its own twists to it and keep it engaging throughout its entire runtime, an absolute classic that deserved all the 8 Oscars that it won!

What the cinematography did for Greece in "Boy On A Dolphin", this film does for Italy. And if you can watch it with the original 4.0 directional dialog soundtrack; you are in for a treat. Utterly enjoyable.

Review: Interesting to see how people looked for marriage back in the 50's. Let's see, working together forming a relationship of respect and friendship, okay. Working together and falling in love, okay. Pretending to like the food he likes, doing the things he likes, just trying to get married, then "surprise," not good. Unfortunately, those parents from the 50's passed on this last method and now we have 50% divorce rate in America.

Movie name: Three Coins in the Fountain
Review: The era of Hollywood on the Tiber produced some beloved classics such as Ben-Hur (1959) and The Barefoot Contessa (1954) but it also produced films that were essentially travelogues. This is one of those films as it is more focused on the beautiful scenery than any of the characters or their various relationships and the hurdles they have to overcome to be together. This made the film a rather dull experience for a modern viewer as while I can see why Americans in the mid 1950s who would probably never go to Europe would be delighted by this film but as somebody who can see images of Rome on the internet I was less enthused. Most viewers today will likely find little to enjoy in the film as it is incredibly light on plot, the performances are forgettable and there is not enough in the visuals to make watching the film a worthwhile experience. Secretary Maria Williams, Maggie McNamara, travels from the United States to Rome, Italy so that she can work for the United States Distribution Agency and serve as a replacement for departing veteran Anita Hutchins, Jean Peters. Hutchins introduces Williams to her roommate Miss Frances, Dorothy McGuire, and the three make wishes as they throw coins into the Trevi fountain. Hutchins is attracted to Italian co-worker Giorgi Bianchi, Rossano Brazzi, who takes her to meet his family but their burgeoning romance is complicated by a no-dating rule at their workplace. Williams falls in love with womanizing Prince Dino di Cessi, Louis Jourdan, but pretends to be somebody she is not to make him like her and eventually reveals her deception causing them to break up. Frances has long held feelings for her elderly landlord John Frederick Shadwell, Clifton Webb, which he is oblivious to and his suggestion of a marriage based on friendship alone offends her. All three women eventually find love. Possibly the most engaging of the three storylines was the third as Frances and Shadwell feel like the most realistic characters in the film and there feelings for one another were driven by real attraction not the prospect of wealth or social climbing. McGuire, typically a low voltage performer, turns in a performance that while never exceptional radiates a certain warmth and naturalism not present in the other three performers. The screenplay also allows for some development in the two characters within this plot strand as Shadwell accepts that he loves a young, sometimes frivolous woman and Frances is able to express herself finally. They also have a proper meeting of minds instead of meeting in front of the fountain and kissing as occurs for the other two couples with their union beginning in a quiet, hopeful fashion. If only some of the care applied to this storyline could have extended to the rest of the film I may have enjoyed it as a light, frothy treat that is not at all mentally taxing. Sadly the film seems to have little care for Williams and Hutchins as they exist merely as vehicles to display the blue waters of Venice or the wide skies of the pastoral landscape that their boyfriends inhabit. I did find the film to be an attractive looking piece of cinema but compared to Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955), which similarly attempts to advertise Hong Kong to Americans, it appeared like your regular CinemaScope production and didn't present enough visual splendor to sell the film alone. McNamara and Peters also deliver bland, uninteresting interpretations of their characters as they add none of the wit or charm that actresses like Jean Simmons and Eleanor Parker could have brought to the same roles. McNamara, irksome in the controversial The Moon Is Blue (1953), brings that high pitched voice and effected tone to a role that asks her to be a beguiling ingénue. Not only does she have a lack of chemistry with Jourdan, an admittedly stolid leading man in this film, but she has no chemistry with her female co-stars either. Peters does not fear much better as the tough talking older woman afraid of having her heart broken with an inability to balance the lighter comedic aspects of the character with her bigger, dramatic moments. The film as a whole was popular diversion in 1954 but has not aged well and has been largely forgotten for a reason.

Movie name: Three Coins in the Fountain
Review: Three bad actresses meet in Italy and set the women's rights movement back a century as they desperately search for a husband so that they can feel they have worth. Yes, I realize this film is a product of its time, and the 1950s wasn't the most progressive time in our history, but I was just stunned with how backwards the thinking was in this movie. Woman #1 has abandoned hopes of finding a husband in Italy, so she plans on moving back to the US to increase her odds of catching one. Woman #2 engages in an extremely elaborate string of lies and tricks in order to manipulate a man into marrying her. And finally, woman #3 convinces her boss (who is clearly gay) to propose to her even though he may die soon and he only proposes to keep her from leaving. So we start with weak characters doing stupid things for pathetic reasons. That would be bad enough but then there's the presentation. The director of this movie clearly had about as much interest in the story as I did, because Three Coins in the Fountain plays more like an elaborate video travelogue. There are literally 5-10 minute montages of images depicting the sites in Rome placed throughout the film. Every time someone steps outside they start up another slideshow of "Places to see in Rome." Hey, and as long as I'm complaining, I might as well mention that the title is even false because only 2 of the women actually drop a coin in the fountain. I swear the best part of this movie was just hearing Sinatra perform the theme song. This was nominated for Best Picture?? Ugh!

Review: This is a classic romance film. Girl and boy meet via deception, but then the deception succumbs to true love. Story line aside, this move is nice to look at. It received the Academy Award for best cinematography, although when you get to use Rome as your backdrop, that's almost like cheating. The unrealistic aspects is how void of people all the major sites are. I doubt they were any less crowded back when this film was made as it is now.The movie opens with the award winning song "Three Coins in the Fountain" sung by Sinatra. I'm not sure I agree with the nomination for best film--not that it's bad, I just didn't think it was spectacular. If you like classic romances, this is a good one for you.

Review: Beautiful scenery is the star of this nice film. Very enjoyable and if not a bit predictable.

Movie name: Three Coins in the Fountain
Review: Three coins, pennies assumedly, were likely used to fund the script and cast members of this enormously dull soaper. A young secretary (Maggie McNamara) heads to Rome, Italy to replace another secretary (Jean Peters) who allegedly is going back to the United States to get married. She meets a man (Rossano Brazzi) that screws everything up. Then there's Dorothy McGuire, Clifton Webb and Louis Jordon that are all part of the forgettable supporting mix. There is no chemistry among the cast members, nor any passion or soul to contribute to the film. Nothing is going on here. I have still have yet to see a good movie with McGuire as she has now entered my least preferred actress books. This film is a prime example of highway robbery, as it was nominated for three Academy Awards including Best Picture (!) of 1954 and was a box office success. People back then deserve better entertainment than this. It's portrayal of Italy is so Hollywoodized. "La Strada," an ITALIAN movie directed by Federico Felini, was released that same year and portrays Italy in a much more natural, more beautiful way than this limpness. "La Strada" is also a great movie in terms of acting and entertainment, one of the best of 1954. This isn't and look at all the nominations it received! Interestingly, this film is part of a group mediocre releases from the 1950's that shares it name with a classic or great song (the other embarrassments are "Love Is a Many Splendored Things" from 1955 and "A Summer Place" from 1959). The one redeeming feature is Frank Sinatra's take on the title tune. Just depressing this movie is and it ranks among the Best Picture nominees "embarrassment" list.

Review: Great movie wonderful

Movie name: The Rose Tattoo
Review: I have found that Tennessee Williams adaptations are hit or miss for me as I love Summer and Smoke (1961), Sweet Bird of Youth (1962) and A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) but I felt actively annoyed during Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) and this film. Part of that is the acting as Geraldine Page, the greatest actress of all time, is enough to buoy even the weakest screenplay while this film features Anna Magnani who is giving a performance tailored for the stage and Burt Lancaster who would mature into a good actor but seems to be struggling at this point. I don't think that this is Williams' best work and because this film is essentially a filmed play that means it's not very engaging and occasionally painful to watch. Italian seamstress Serafina Delle Rose, Anna Magnani, is widowed when her philandering husband Rosario, who has a giant rose tattoo on his chest, dies in a car accident. She grieves intensely and limits her libidinous young daughter Rosa, Marisa Pavan, from consummating her relationship with Jack Hunter, Ben Cooper. Her life is turned upside down when she discovers her husband's infidelity and meets the erratic Alvaro Mangiacavallo, Burt Lancaster, who quickly develops a romantic obsession with her. The two argue on their first date as she is overwhelmed by memories of her husband and confronts his mistress during their date. The next morning the two affirm their love for one another however as Delle Rose reconciles with her daughter and comes to terms with her grief. I have to admit that I was simply confused at several points in this film. A Streetcar Named Desire is successfully able to imply rape and prostitution while not explicitly referencing or showing anything. This film doesn't do that quite so successfully as it seems as though Alvaro has issues with alcoholism and also may be slightly mental, that may have just been Lancaster's portrayal, and yet the film wraps up as though he has no issues. The melodrama of Delle Rose's relationship with her dead husband is also not particularly interesting because we don't understand why she would have felt such a deep connection to him when we only see her kiss his back and tell him she loves him. I needed to understand what the various vices of the major love interest were and, crucially, I needed to care about these people and their relationships for this film to work. The issue may be in the direction because Daniel Mann also directed the abhorrent BUtterfield 8 (1960) and while this film is markedly better than that one it shares a lot of the same problems. This is the sort of material that clearly has an element of camp to it and yet Mann never seems to know this and treats the source material as though it is deathly serious sapping it of a lot of the fun that should be there while allowing for hammy performances. He also fails to stage the play in a way that is interesting or inspired as we might as well be watching people on the stage for all of the natural movement that they make. Sure we get a bit of variety in locations and Mann seems to be aware of the fact that having the characters leave the house gives the story some much needed room to breathe. Frankly I can see why Mann did not receive an Academy Award nomination for his direction and I can only hope that he produced a piece of work as good as his debut feature Come Back, Little Sheba (1952). The performers are also difficult to appreciate by today's standards because Magnani is doing far too much in her role and Lancaster seems fatally miscast. When watching Magnani perform I was reminded of Cher in Moonstruck (1987), in the negative sense, because she was so heavy with the accent and the hand gestures in every scene that it was hard to look past that and see any depth in her portrayal of the character. Personally, I would have awarded Best Actress to Eleanor Parker in Interrupted Melody (1955) over Magnani in this film. Lancaster is actually pretty awful as I was never sure of what he was going for, were we meant to believe he was so lovesick that he was making nonsensical decisions or was it meant to be darker and he was just mentally unstable? I feel as though the audience never finds out and that hurts a film that is meant to leave you in a chipper mood. In other words, this is not a film that's worthy of your time and I would suggest that you watch other Williams adaptations before seeing this film.

Movie name: The Rose Tattoo
Review: This is such a strange film. At first I thought it was a heavy drama with all these deep emotional things going on. But then there were moments of real levity, to the point that I was almost laughing out loud, but then it would get dark again. I found it tough to nail down the genre, and part of that was the performance of Anna Magnani. She plays the vast majority of this film very straight, so its hard to think of it as a comedy, even when Burt Lancaster is hamming it up in the same scene. She is going through some serious things in her life and she takes it out on everyone around her. I was starting to get very impatient with The Rose Tattoo, because everything centered around Magnanis character and she is so unpleasant. There are also a lot of little subplots swirling around her. While they play into the main storyline either directly or indirectly, it takes some time before you can get your bearings and understand what story they want to tell. The entire film was a mixed bag for me, because at times I was enjoying it, then Id be annoyed by it, and then Id just be confused. It never had the kind of focus and direction that I wanted, so it didnt impact me as powerfully as I think they intended. Still, I will admit that The Rose Tattoo has some strong performances and a few scenes that are enjoyable.

The way she claps her hands when she's nervous, her laughs, her big gestures and hot blooded personality. The movie goes great, until Burt Lancaster places on the screen with that ugly, overacted and annoying as hell performance. God, he was miscast in this movie. If I were the director, I would have shot him, for almost have killed the movie. This only didn't happen because of Magnani.

Review: While this doesn't reach the extraordinary heights of Hitchcock's masterpieces like STRANGERS ON A TRAIN and PSYCHO, I'm learning that second-tier Hitchcock is still better than the vast majority of movies out there! This is an extraordinarily entertaining caper film filled with game performances and some wonderful scenery of France. Truth be told, I was less interested in the titular catching of a thief and more enamored in the relationship between Grant and Kelly, who have a fantastic chemistry together. Watching them together is pure joy! I'm ashamed to admit that my knowledge of classic film needs improvement, but watching this makes me very anxious to check out more movies in both Grant's and Kelly's filmography. The rooftop climax is expertly directed, and this is an elegant, classy cat and mouse game.

Movie name: To Catch a Thief
Review: Classic Hitchcock film with Grace Kelly (in her final film with Hitch) in her finest ice queen role. Cary Grant plays John Robie, The Cat, a notorious burglar turned French Resistance hero once WWII broke out. Now retired and living in the French Riviera, he finds himself framed for a series of jewel robberies fitting his prior M.O. My only complaint about this film is that the mystery itself is not all that compelling, but the chemistry between the charming Grant and the icy Kelly is legendary! It's pretty typical of Hitchcock to let the story or plot take a backseat to set pieces and interesting scenes. Also, Grant and Kelly give audiences what is arguably the greatest onscreen kiss of all time, standing on a balcony at a lush Monaco hotel with fireworks exploding in the background. Grant and Ingrid Bergman are close runners-up in Hitchcock's NOTORIOUS, but my all-time favorite movie kiss goes to Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly in Hitchcocks's REAR WINDOW. Hitch knows kissing, but besides kissing, he delivers his usual memorable suspense set pieces and makes wonderful use of the Monaco locations. However, the most unsettling part of the film is when Kelly recklessly drives along a mountain road with Grant, which years later would be this same road the real-life Princess Grace would die in a fatal car crash. Overall, this is a suspense film classic and among Hitchcock's best, but not quite among his top-tier films (which would be NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO, REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, NOTORIOUS, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, and SHADOW OF A DOUBT).

Review: What the film lacks in substance it more than makes up for in charm, colour and sumptuous locations beautifully captured by Burks' camera. Grant and Kelly are excellent, as is Landis as Kelly's boozy mother. Kelly looks radiant and is elegantly dressed in Edith Head's costumes. Hitchcock adds some neat touches through the shot set-up and keeps the tone humorous throughout, occasionally adding moments of tension – notably in the well-staged rooftop climax. The result is a winning movie that breezes along on the chemistry of its stars.

Review: Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are perfectly cast in To Catch a Thief from director icon Alfred Hitchcock that follows Grant's character John Robi, as he tries to track down a cat burglar, who everyone thinks is him. The film gleams 1950s charm and elegance with fantastic cinematography of the French Riviera landscape.

Movie name: To Catch a Thief
Review: This is an entertaining watch, with different characters trying to second guess who the titular thief is. I enjoyed the setting, the glitzy French riviera and of course the cast includes two pretty big names - Grace Kelly and Cary Grant. Cary Grant comes across as quite suave and sophisticated as his character, John Robie. I thought this was a nice, fun watch, with inevitably a hint of nostalgia about it (it was released in 1955). There are the scenes with women fighting over the male lead character and I suppose it has a hint of a James Bond film about it - if any then I guess it'd have to be 'Casino Royale', although this is decidedly less an action/thriller film and more a somewhat light romantic drama, with some fairly witty pieces of dialogue at times. It is a little cliched and not, overall, greatly exciting as such (there are some fairly thrilling scenes but only now and again) but I enjoyed it for the most part (cliches and slowish plot pace aside) and I would recommend it to others regardless as a good(ish) watch, yes.

Review: When I think Hitchcock, beautiful scenery and breathtaking cinematography are not the first things that come to mind, so it was a huge surprise that they were some of the strongest aspects of this film. Utilizing VistaVision the audience is treated to gorgeously sweeping shots of the Cote d'Azur as cars race along cliffsides, sets staged at breathtaking villas, and shots of a decadent period ball that present an eye poppingly pleasing color palette, dripping with texture. The script is solid as well, offering a well plotted mystery with stimulating dialogue that makes it easy to remain engaged and entertained. Grant and Kelly act as the cherry on top as their chemistry creates a magnetic quality in their characters that make them hard to look away from, especially when on screen together. 7.5/10 NYT 1000: #280

Movie name: To Catch a Thief
Review: Cary Grant and Grace Kelly aren't the best actors of classic Hollywood so it's no wonder the film had no one to carry it. To Catch a Thief is dull and uninteresting despite its intriguing story of a jewel thief mystery and that's largely due to the mediocre performances and lack of action. The big reveal at the end was predictable which made the ending unsatisfactory.

Movie name: To Catch a Thief
Review: Far from Hitchcock's Best work but a still thrilling crime mystery. Cary Grant and Grace Kelly as you would expect bounce off each other well with the witty romantic writing. Weirdly all of Bertani's lines are out of sync and seemingly ADR but it's so terribly done. I wouldn't mind knowing the limitations of the time but no other characters' lines are so terribly synced or said. Even with that it still a very fun watch.

Movie name: To Catch a Thief
Review: Fun and entertaining. This Hitchcock movie is more lighthearted and more upbeat than his other works. The supposed plot twist is relatively predictable but the focus of this who done it movie is not the suspects but the chemistry between a dandy debonair Cary Grant and Grace Kelly with a bubbly personality and dewy charm.

Review: Hitch combining his favourite leading man with his favourite leading lady for his best romance. Not one of Hitch's suspenseful thrill rides but Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are magnificent opposite each other. The chemistry is palpable and you can see why they were great friends. Grant's comic timing is first rate and the cinematography from Robert Burks is outstanding with the latter getting a deserved Oscar. Whilst it's not as nuanced or suspenseful like his best works it's still right up there for me and definitely underrated. Entertaining, funny, flows beautifully plus has the beautiful backdrop of the French Riviera. Will never tire of it.

Review: Enjoyed this classic in Grace Kelly's last big film, she was paired with a guy more than twice her age in Carey Grant. Nothing to see here... that aside it's a cracking yarn, simple plot, predictable twist but a fun setup that doesn't really get boring.

Review: Classic Hitchcock film starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. It's not his best movie, but it's certainly very entertaining like most of his movies. It has action, mystery and some comedy.

Movie name: Somebody Up There Likes Me
Review: One of Paul Newman's first starring roles as real-life boxer Rocky Graziano is a dynamite biopic. From his youth as a NYC street tough from a broken home, committing petty crimes, he ends up in juvenile detention, then prison, and later in the army where he deserts, only to turn his life around when he sees his potential as a boxer. Newman is very much in his Actor's Studio Lee Strasberg method acting mode, which comes off very odd compared to when he'd later relax his acting style and embrace just being himself onscreen, which is what made him a star (Which is what most movie stars do. Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, or Tom Hanks are always just Jimmy, Cary, or Tom whether they are in a comedy, drama, or whatever.). The film was directed by the under-appreciated Robert Wise, who directed multiple classic films (THE HAUNTING, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, etc.) and is a director who is not talked about enough in film circles, which I think is a result of him not having a discernible style or consistent theme to his films, much like the equally under-appreciated George Roy Hill (THE STING, THE GREAT WALDO PEPPER, SLAP SHOT, etc.), and was written by Ernest Lehman, who wrote or co-wrote multiple classics including SABRINA, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, WEST SIDE STORY, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, and many more, serve up a terrific melodrama. Look fast for Steve McQueen in a bit part as one of Newman's street tough friends early in the film. Robert Loggia (BIG, SCARFACE) and Dean Jones (THE LOVE BUG, THAT DARN CAT!) also make their film debut in this film. My main complaint about the film is that although based on a true story, it does feel like a cliched Horatio Alger story, but despite that, it's super entertaining. FUN FACT! James Dean was originally cast as Graziano before his untimely death at 24 years old. In real life, he and leading lady Pier Angeli (who also died young at 39) were carrying on an affair at the time, which would have made for some real-life onscreen chemistry. BONUS FILM RECOMMENDATION: If you'd like to see an excellent but very different boxing picture from the director of this film, check out THE SET-UP, a terrific hard-boiled film noir about boxer Robert Ryan being forced to throw a fight. The film has the fun gimmick of taking place in real-time over the course of just over an hour.

Review: Paul Newman as much as I love most of his performances can't play a New York Italian American no matter how hard he tried. The movie was contrite and filled with many dishonesty's. And as much as I loved Rocky Graziano, it was hard for me to root for a man who deserted the army. It would've been better off if rather than telling this rather large fairytale, we told the true story maybe I would've enjoyed it better.

Review: This is a fantastic performance by Paul Newman playing ex world champion Rocky Graziano. Rocky was a troubled youngster who was always in trouble with the law. He had a great mother who loved him to death and an angry father who took his anger out on Rocky. Rocky grew up a criminal but when he was introduced to boxing it was the greatest thing that happened to his life. This really is a great boxing movie and a must see

Review: Good 1956 Pro Boxing flick. I new next to nothing about ROCKY GRAZIANO, nor the champ he beat... ZALE, and PIER ANGELI was just an actress with an odd name... Pier. Newman doing a great 'ROCKY' imitation, like Stallone. But he and the other boxers didn't look in good enuf shape to be fighters. But that was then. & now I am smitten with PIER. And SAL MINEO in small role. Too bad he and Pier both died young. Never heard of this movie until saw on THE MOVIE CHANNEL, 3.6.2021

Review: Oh how I love this movie. Paul Newman and Sal Mineo are both fantastic in it. Made me research Rocky Graziank more. Such an interesting story.

Movie name: Somebody Up There Likes Me
Review: Worth watching. Cannot help but compare the movie to Sly Stallone's Rocky. Stallone's Rocky was fictional, based on Chuck Wepner, whereas Newman's was based on a real life story. Paul Newman, of course, is head and shoulders above Stallone in his performance. Scripts of both movies are very, very similar, almost identical. But the acting of Newman and his love interest is so much better, that it is almost an unfair comparison. Good movie.

Review: Boxer Rocky Graziano's biopic, based on his autobiography, from childhood to his World Middleweight Championship title win at age 28 in 1947. Paul Newman's talent is large and flexible, revealing an approach to the Graziano character that scores tremendously. Robert Wise's sports biopic of Rocky Graziano deservedly catapulted Paul Newman to major stardom; you can spot in small parts Steve McQueen, before he became a star, and Sal Mineo. Pier Angeli plays Norma Graziano and she add so much to the film who always looks out for Graziano the man, as opposed to Graziano the boxer. Angeli plays the part well . Great film .

Movie name: Somebody Up There Likes Me
Review: This was Paul Newman's second film, and because his first was so poor, it was the one that launched his career. He got the role of Rocky Graziano after James Dean, who was originally cast, tragically died. Graziano is shown for a good portion of the film as an out of control young man, stealing things, running rackets, and defying authority - even that of the US Army. Newman plays the part reasonably well, and though he was a little over-the-top at times, his presence and charisma more than make up for it. While the story is somewhat predictable, since we know Graziano will someday be a world champion boxer, it's well told by director Robert Wise, and not shy about showing us his shortcomings (with the real Graziano's full approval). His relationship with his father (Harold J. Stone), who had his own boxing dreams frustrated, is very touching. The real hero of the story is his wife (Pier Angeli), who always looks out for Graziano the man, as opposed to Graziano the boxer. Angeli plays the part well, playing her supportive scenes without being cloying, getting tough when she needs to be, and having a couple of very cute scenes with their daughter (Angela Cartwright) besides. "Baby, your father is the champ," exclaims mom. "I have to go to the bathroom," the little one replies. It's in human moments like these that make the film, and the action in the final boxing match is pretty good as well.

Review: Constant une histoire probablement très romancée de Rocky Graziano, Somebody Up There Likes Me est un très bon film de Robert Wise, une success story dans le monde de la boxe des années 50s, avec un Paul Newman absolument stellaire dans le rôle principal (prenant la suite d'un James Dean qui mourut juste avant le tournage) et un supporting cast extrêmement solide, Everett Sloane en tête. Très drôle et pourtant souvent émouvant, le film de Robert Wise est un film constamment divertissant, qui parvient à être très concis (le monteur Albert Akst s'est surpassé pour son dernier film) et à enchaîner, avec les moyens du bord, près de 20 ans d'une vie bien rempli, entre la délinquance, l'armée, la prison et le monde de la boxe professionnelle. Somebody Up There Likes Me est un excellent film, qui a clairement servi d'inspiration à Sly pour Rocky.

Movie name: Somebody Up There Likes Me
Review: Robert Wise has a lot to answer for - after all, he is responsible for editing The Magnificent Ambersons when it was taken away from Orson Welles (there is also The Sound of Music). But he does know how to craft a film - something he may have learned when he was part of Val Lewton's stable of directors doing low budget but effective horror films in the '40's. You can see this craft in films like Odds Against Tomorrow or The Haunting...and in this film which is based on boxer Rocky Graziano's autobiography (with a screenplay by Ernest "North by Northwest" Lehman). Paul Newman is young and hungry as Rocky - and once you get used to his cruddy Brooklyn accent, his performance is electrifying. Method acting probably but it works and everything hangs together just right. Wise creates a good sense of time and place and, although predictable, the story is punchy and compelling. You can see how this may have influenced Scorsese's Raging Bull. Won an Oscar for B&W cinematography and it shows.

Review: The film more or less a Shoe In for James Dean straight after Giant but as we all know his life was tragically cut short. Even his stunning partner Pier was in this film also. Thankfully they didn't replace Dean with any hack they got a little unknown talented called Paul Newman at the time. The story of a trouble maker, somewhat drifter turning Pro Boxer to change his self restricting lifestyle. Although a little too handsome for a street thug Newman was he delivered with an intense & emotionally charged performance. This is a good a film & although a little patchy in parts it's a incredible debut for Paul Newman.

Movie name: Around the World in 80 Days
Review: This movie is an underrated classic from the 2000s that deserves more appreciation!!! It has all the elements of a feel-good movie that leaves you smiling. Featuring the one and only Jackie Chan, this film is a perfect blend of action, humor, and charm that showcases Chan's unique mix of martial arts and comedic timing. The dynamic between Jackie Chan’s Passepartout and Steve Coogan’s eccentric Phileas Fogg is nothing short of delightful! Coogan, as the bumbling yet brilliant inventor, brings warmth and humor to the role, and his chemistry with Chan is effortlessly enjoyable. The supporting cast, including some surprise cameos, only adds to the fun, making it a film that works for viewers of all ages. For me, it's one of Jackie Chan's most enjoyable films from that era, and a movie I find myself revisiting whenever I need something fun and heartwarming. It's a feel-good film through and through, and it's great that it's available on Netflix to rediscover today.

Review: Classic 00's Nonsense and a really bad remake. The editing is terrible. This not only is as unfocused as the 56' one but add on the TERRIBLE comedy and the multiple dumb/bad subplots and you can see why this never works in the slightest. Passeport's village and "spy" subplot, the romance, the bank robber subplot all feels like a complete mess. Why they made it so complicated for such a simple and fun story is beyond me. The pacing is terrible. This never stops with the nonsense 80% of the time. Everything else isn't good here. EASILY the best thing is Kathy Bates cameo at the end. Chan & Coogan have no chemistry at all and are weighed down by the bad humor terribly throughout this. It also feels like Jackie chan's fighting scenes are from a different movie almost and feel so out of place at times. The biggest issue here is completely gone is the sense of adventure and wonder the 56' one had. And yet SOMEHOW despite knocking off a hour off the runtime which EASILY should make it better, they take 40 minutes before the journey even begins...so it ends up taking LONGER than the 3 hour one to start. How do you do that...like seriously. The CGI is completely out of place. This never shows any of the cool locations besides a few small handful of scenes that probably add up to under a minute. Skip This. The 56' one which isn't good either but beats this by leaps and bounds. I don't get why it's so hard to make this into something fun and adventourous but not mindless and dumb Spielberg needs to try making this right.

Movie name: Around the World in 80 Days
Review: Jackie Chan and Steve Coogan star in this film based on Jules Verne’s 1873 novel. Taking place in the late 1800’s, Phileas Fogg must circumnavigate the globe in 80 days to win a bet. It is always a pleasure to watch Jackie Chan work. His stunt choreography and sense of humor are truly appreciated! His on screen chemistry with Steve Coogan isn’t great and the story drags on a bit and is predictable. There are some computer graphics in this film that do not hold up, but as most of the film is somewhat cartoonish in nature they work to a degree. If you like Jackie Chan movies or are in the mood for a cartoonish adventure then check this movie out.

My daughter and I will have to watch it again as we laughed over so much. The three main characters were wonderful and and I found the friendship element delightful.

Review: I note that some of the negative sentiment around this film is due to its disregard for Verne's source material. Quite frankly, that is a rather silly reason upon which to base a review, in my opinion and I am more than happy to take this film on its own merits and review it for how I found it to be. Which was hilarious. This is a film that rarely lets up the humour from beginning to end. From hilarious lines to well choreographed slapstick, I found this film to be pure unadulterated entertainment. Both my wife and I were laughing out loud throughout most of the film. The story is, of course, rather silly and anyone really trying to look at this through the lens of a cohesive plot was never going to be able to enjoy what was on offer. This is comedy told through a series of related sketches. Not all of it works, but most of it does. Extremely entertaining if you let go.

Excetuando as tomadas de ação em que o adorável Jackie Chan, sempre demonstra todo o seu potencial e destreza, um tanto quanto cansativo...

Review: This is a movie I watch as a young kid, so I have quite a bit of nostalgia for it. However, watching it again, although I have some very good things to say about the movie, most notably the set and the costumes and backgrounds and environments being top-notch, and also they hired really good actors who could actually speak the foreign languages. The execution is not so great! A lot of things happen in the movie inexplicably (Like how does phileas fogg cross the pacific ocean in a mere 5 DAYS) and the turkey scene was pretty bad. It's ok some good some bad

Since there were so many supporting appearances, it was exciting to see who would appear next. Jackie Chan is a genuinely gifted actor. The brutality was a little lighthearted, but the results were real. I liked how each nation became magical as they departed for the next.

Review: This Disney movie was pretty good. Jackie Chan, Steve Coogan, Cecile de France, Jim Braodbent, and the rest of the cast did a pretty good job in this movie. The story of the movie was adventurous and entertaining. It's about going on an adventure not only to prove people wrong, but to experience other cultures and make friends along the way. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you may enjoy it. It's a great movie for an entire family.

A casual Patriot, who doesn’t even want to be there and lacks any training, not only saves the day, but effortlessly scores with any skirt that happens across his path.

Review: Powerful, Complex, Moving, and a unique narrative make this one of the best war movies of all time. Colonel Nicholson is one of my favorite characters off all time. This is truly like watching a Shakespeare Play unfold. The Plot is so complex and for a 1950's movie it is so ahead of its time. William Holden is masterful as well. Overall some of the best acting I have ever seen, Wonderful Soundtrack, Perfectly Paced and incredibly ambitious cinematography. The Editing is extremely well done as well.

Movie name: The Bridge on the River Kwai
Review: David Lean is the master of the epic film genre and in addition to "The Bridge on the River Kwai" his credits include "Lawrence of Arabia", "Summertime" and "A Passage to India" in addition to several other masterworks. The film opens in a Japanese POW camp in 1943 and we are shown the terrible condition of the prisoners as well as the stubborn and heartless Japanese Commander, Colonel Saito. We are introduced to the newest batch of prisoners who are to build a bridge over the River Kwai in order to connect tracks for the Japanese trains. The first hour of the film shows several characters, all of whom are well developed and know who they are which is captured by the actors with stunning proficiency! We see intimate details of their lives and morals as well as what they stand for and we even see the Japanese Colonel slowly becoming a more understanding person, at least compared to what he was. In an escape attempt an American POW Shears (Played by William Holden) is able to make his way out of hostile territory and on to safe grounds, only to be sent back as a guide in order to avoid a court trial for impersonating an officer which made no difference in his treatment anyways. You have to feel bad for the guy, but even worse are the conditions of those sick and injured who are still working on the bridge despite their conditions due to the British colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) having gone mad and obsessing over the finishing of the bridge. The team that is lead by Shears is ordered to go in and blow up the newly finished bridge and we are left with loads of suspense the final half hour of the film. The term epic is rightfully used here as the film, while having detailed characters and a human condition theme, is also grand in scale and has the talent to pull it all off. David Lean shows his genius in the Director's chair and the cinematography is beautiful (It looks absolutely stunning on the new 4k transfer on blu-ray) and all the actors do a terrific job in breathing life into their own characters. This is a Classic film and deserves the rank of #36 on AFI's Top 100 Films of All Time, Highly Recommended!

Review: Picks up in the second half with a decent ending. Shame the first half was awash with so much forced moralising. Some of the characters were cartoonish but there's enough in the plot to keep it just on tracks. Watched on Amazon Prime

Movie name: The Defiant Ones
Review: Really, really great acting makes this movie work. Poitier and Curtis kept my interest from start to finish. Clever plot with the main theme of interracial relationships.

Movie name: The Defiant Ones
Review: Rarely do you find a movie that focuses on the social aspect that much while also having an entertaining plot and suspense. Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis give moving performances, in addition to Stanley Kramer's magic. The Defiant Ones is a masterpiece.

Movie name: The Defiant Ones
Review: The Defiant Ones is an odd couple prison break drama pairing Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis on the run and free from their cell but still remaining shackled and chained at the wrist. This film is at its best when focused on the interplay between Curtis and Poitier, their divide heightened over racial difference (and supported by sharp dialogue exchanges between the two) but ultimately leading to a bond that asks what is freedom without loyalty. The film does falter where focused on the pursuit of the escapees however Theodore Bikel as Sherrif does do an admirable job of keeping his gun toting, trigger happy deputies at bay, a theme echoed later where the the duo are at the mercy of a murderous lynch mob. I'm absolutely stumped about the meanings and relevance of the song Poitier sings at various intervals - something about a bowling green and a kitten sitting on a sewing machine?!? This was no doubt the inspiration for AIP's excellently titled 1970s Blaxploitation actioner 'Black Mama, White Mama'.

Movie name: The Defiant Ones
Review: Two convicts, one a black man and the other a racist, chained together, escape from custody after being involved in a car accident while being transported and battle their own demons while trying to evade their pursuers. While The Defiant One's racial themes resolve themselves in a predictable manner, the movie is a thrilling cat and mouse game and leaves the audience guessing until the final scene. Sydney Poitier and Tony Curtis are excellent in the lead roles and the black and white cinematography, especially the shallow focus shots, is striking. While too much time may have been dedicated to the seemingly incompetent pursuers (why is one of the deputies allowed to play his radio at full volume throughout the chase?), it remains an engrossing film with important messages.

Movie name: The Defiant Ones
Review: A classic thriller based around race, preconceptions, and mutual respect. Characters act out on impulse based on their typically exaggerated assumptions of those they don't know, and it's not just limited to the main characters portrayed by Poitier and Curtis; the formerly abused citizen that saves the pair from a lynching party having empathized with their situation, for instance. Our two prisoner protagonists never come together to have a Kumbaya moment, instead building a mutual respect based on shared hardships, similar past experiences, and a longing for freedom; there's an undeniable idealism to their character development, but at the same time the two air their grievances openly instead of hiding behind softer language. In 1958, it was still a radical message that plenty of Americans didn't want to hear. There does seem to be a bit of a missed opportunity in the film's design associated with the party of law enforcement hunting down the protagonists, given that they are never really depicted as threatening in any capacity. Oftentimes, the brief jumps back to their group take the audience out of the story (providing context that removes what could have been an oppressive atmosphere) and instead replaces it with comic relief and a jazzy, saxophone-heavy soundtrack. Both Poitier and Curtis are solid throughout, and there is some creative camerawork that might surprise you given the film's status as a predominantly 'socially conscious work, such as characters running directly to the camera and a great panning shot over a town that the pair attempt to sneak into. There are idealistic elements that make The Defiant Ones seem a bit dated with so many decades of heavier race-based films to compare it to, but as a product of its time you can't complain. (3.5/5)

Review: A never ending parade of great performances make this a strong film.

Movie name: The Defiant Ones
Review: What's really special about the movie is the development of Poitier and Curtis as two men shackled together who have to depend on each other. A real bond is forged between the two as characters – and as actors. Curtis, who got his only Oscar nomination for this role, insisted that Poitier get equal billing in the movie. Poitier was treated equally by the Academy, too, getting the same Best Supporting Actor nomination that Curtis received.

Movie name: The Defiant Ones
Review: Stanley Kramer deserves a much higher seat in the pantheon of Hollywood notoriety. With films like "The Defiant Ones, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, The Men, Judgment at Nuremberg, Inherit the Wind, Ship of Fools, High Noon, The Cain Mutiny, and Home of the Brave," Kramer's work has forever raised the consciousness of the American people like no other. Having often been jeered the "message director," Kramer was forced to endure condescension from the likes of the quintessential Pauline Kael and others; but it's time to bring back his legacy with a dutiful remake of the "Defiant Ones." Not only is it a great film technically, our Country is crying out for guidance and the return to compassion and humanity that this film aptly projects. COVID-19 has shackled us together, all of us, and we need the kind of road map "The Defiant Ones" can provide.

Movie name: The Defiant Ones
Review: Stanley Kramer's authorship can now be seen as topical tackles in forming social commentary exposure to go as far as timeless relevance. The directorial peacemaker boldly tested how primitively western the south is by counteracting with nonviolent resolutions and then secretly unveil how much a bond can be the hidden truth between two different ethics. Finely themed in communication while being verbally and physically delivered symbolically by Sydney Poitier and Tony Curtis's exceptionally humble performances as expected. (B+)

Review: I really liked this movie. There are parts of it that are slow moving, but there are parts that are really engaging as well. I love the section where they meet up with the woman and her son.

Movie name: The Defiant Ones
Review: Although I can appreciate that Sidney Poitier was a significant cultural figure and he pushed forward representation of African Americans in mainstream cinema I don't think that he is a fantastic actor. His limited range is put on show in this Stanley Kramer "message movie" which drums the same message into it's audience over and over again. There is little of the depth of John Cassavetes' Shadows (1959) which would deal with more subtle forms of racism and it doesn't provide the entertainment value supposedly derived from this simplistic of a film. 61 years later it is hard to see why this film garnered so many Academy Award nominations as it appears exceedingly dull. Two prisoners, the white John "Joker" Johnson, Tony Curtis, and the African-American Noah Cullen, Sidney Poitier, are chained together and escape when the truck they are being transported to prison in drives off the road. They learn to work together as they are tasked with climbing out of a ravine by standing on each other's shoulders and hiding out from those pursuing them. The lazy Sheriff Max Muller, Theodore Bikel, comes after them but is halfhearted in his attempts to capture them. At one point the two men find themselves close to getting lynched as the people at a turpentine camp are suspicious of them. They are set free by Big Sam, Lon Chaney Jr., who was a prisoner himself and are found by the young Billy, Kevin Coughlin, and his mother, Cara Williams, who is strongly attracted to Johnson. She plots to keep him as her husband and help him evade the police but wants to rid herself of Cullen whom she believes will only endanger them and has strong racist feelings toward him. Johnson is hurt by her betrayal and goes after his friend so that they can be reunited. Setting itself up as a buddy movie early on you expect the film to be more interested in deepening the connection between it's characters than it is. We see the time occupied with scenes of the men running or supporting white characters being overtly racist. This leaves us with little time to appreciate the dynamic between our two leads as Johnson and Cullen feel like stock characters and their banter is never particularly witty or insightful. Poitier puts on his usual angry but noble act and rushes a lot of his lines while Curtis has an unconvincing southern accent and shouts most of his one liners. They either have a real lack of chemistry or just not enough time to develop a solid rapport as they seem to be more occupied with their physical appearances and sticking to the public personas that they were known for than developing real, authentic characters with depth. Kramer deserves a lot of criticism for this as this is an issue in most of his films, often with the racial minority characters, as they have to be practically perfect and often lack in personality while the white actors are pushed to chew the scenery in their roles. The story of the film itself is unremarkable as we have seen the story of two completely different people becoming close friends while on the run a million times before. Kramer adds nothing new to this formula and doesn't make it as enjoyable as even an average 1980s comedy like Midnight Run (1988) or Stakeout (1987). The interest could have come when the men meet a femme fatale, she is never named, yet Kramer isn't willing to sow the seeds allowing us to slowly realize her racism and has her explicitly state her feelings to Johnson instead. There is none of the intrigue or build up that would exist inside a superior film and we never get Johnson weighing up his options as we trust that he will simply run after the man he has known for all of a few days after learning about his lover's plans. It was difficult to care at any point and while the film is only 96 minutes it felt much longer than The Razor's Edge (1946) or any of the other far superior films I have seen recently. I would recommend that audience members looking for a stimulating experience watch Inherit the Wind (1960), one of the few Kramer productions that aged well.

Movie name: The Defiant Ones
Review: A prison truck is transporting a group of convicts when it runs off the road and crashes. Two convicts escape - Johnny (Tony Curtis), a white man, and Cullen (Sydney Poitier), a black man. They loathe each other, especially as Johnny is an ignorant racist. However, they are chained together and have to rely on each other to escape and survive. Meanwhile, the State Police plus the local Sheriff and a ragtag bunch of deputies, assisted by tracker dogs, are hot on their trail. With enough thrilling action to keep it enjoyable today, this is an important film that provided Poitier with a breakthrough role and helped Curtis to escape the simplistic hero mode in which his talents had too often been wasted. If you look closely, you'll notice that the actor playing Angus is former Little Rascal Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer, making his last screen appearance. This is one of underrated producer/director Stanley Kramer's finest humanitarian films. The performances by Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier are virtually flawless.

Movie name: The Defiant Ones
Review: The best, GREATEST thrilling and inspiring movie ever made! With 2 of the best movie characters ever portrayed: Tony Curtis as John Jackson and Sidney Poitier as Noah Cullen!

Movie name: The Defiant Ones
Review: An impressively tense film. Poitier and Curtis are both incredible. The lack of background music provides for an impressive setting that adds stress and meaning. Occasionally the anti-racism message is a bit on the nose, but generally it’s woven into the actions of the two men and so the climax feels earned.

Review: I'm not one to leave reviews on movies, however it's been a year since I saw Gigi and Nate and it's still stuck with me since then. The film received a lot of criticism for reasons I'll never understand. Though, as someone who's disabled and thus has a service animal like the one of the titular characters, Nate Gibson, I found this movie to be both inspiring and motivating. The dynamic between Nate and his family is heartwarming, and so is his unforgettable bond with Gigi. 10/10, would give more stars if I could.

Movie name: Gigi & Nate
Review: A predictable movie about the connection between a quadriplegic and his service animal. It wants itself to be inspiring, emotional and a bit political about how the animals should be treated. But it just meanders through a variety of these subjects without really making an impression on any front. There were a few effective moments but that would be more due to simply the subject matter and some actors doing great with what they got. There's a lot I enjoyed in it but at the same time, it was also boring as a whole. It felt like it touched upon a lot of stuff that could have been explored more to make a better film but was afraid to go deep and just touched all those stuff on the surface and moved on. Considering this is not exactly a true story, it's amusing that both the main events are implied to happen due to the same girl who just comes in at that point just for that and not really even mentioned how much she has a part in this.

Review: Did you know that most primate pets are neglected and live lonely, depressed lives? I did not take a primatology class in college, but I do know that primates belong with other primates and NOT humans! Monkeys have special behavioral and social needs that cannot be satisfied by humans. A monkey as a social service animal is a a very miserable one. I do understand that this is fiction, but lots of kids will watch this and get the wrong message. This movie should have been about Nate saving Gigi, not the reverse.

Movie name: Gigi & Nate
Review: I found this film to be quite watchable and enjoyable. The storyline had the potential to be engaging and exciting, but I felt that the character of Nate was portrayed in a negative light. He came across as constantly angry and mean, lacking depth and development that could have made him more relatable and likable. This portrayal of his character may have hindered the overall impact of the film. Despite the shortcomings in character development, I believe that the film itself was not bad and is worth watching at least a couple of times. However, it may not be a movie that I would include in my regular rotation of favorites. The actors in the film delivered exceptional performances, showcasing their talent and bringing life to the story. Their portrayals were captivating and added to the overall appeal of the movie. While the acting was commendable, I believe that the writing could have been more detailed and nuanced to enhance the depth of the storyline and characters. In conclusion, while the film had its strengths, particularly in the performances of the actors, there is room for improvement in the writing and character development to elevate the overall viewing experience.

Movie name: The Diary of Anne Frank
Review: An All Time Classic powered by phenomenal acting and a sweeping musical score. The cinematography works beautifully. The black and white ascetics work beautifully and despite the setting being only a small attic it is extremely memorable and intimate because of how well framed shots are. Despite the editing being solid overall and the pacing very well this does have some marginal issues particularly in the first half. Things can just sort of happen with no clear idea who the main character is but there really good scenes still. Also some scenes can go on a bit too long throughout but there good scenes so its not that big a deal but it does a dd up a bit by the halfway point. The second half focuses way more on Anne and evokes a lot more emotion. This is a really sad but moving film about the coming of age, a historical account of a terrible event, and the human spirit. Everyone should see this once.

Movie name: The Diary of Anne Frank
Review: A brilliant and heartbreaking retelling of one of the most tragic stories of WWII, combined with Stevens's direction, Goodrich and Hackett's script, the performances of the cast, Newman's score, Mellor's cinematography, the editing by Bretherton, Mace and Swink, Davis and Wheeler's art direction, Reiss and Scott's set decoration, LeMaire and Wills's costume design, character values and emotional weight, The Diary Of Anne Frank recreates in great detail one of WWII's most tragic moments!!!

Movie name: The Diary of Anne Frank
Review: As important to watch now as when it was released. The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) is a tearful and poignant take on Anne Frank tragic brief life. It is so suspenseful and will make you hold your breath. The sound design is phenomenal as you hear all the grand silence and the quiet whispers to the loud crashes and incessant bombings with stunning sound choices. Director George Stevens uses every clever directorial move to build suspense from slow panning shots, tender close-up shots, sudden edits to new rooms, and sweeping shots to change viewpoints. Stevens also masterfully lit his black and white world. The soft lighting at night, illuminating people partly in shadow, moving silhouettes, light flashing in the darkness, and lighting up faces in the darkness. All of these techniques are still effective while watching The Diary of Anne Frank. The main star here is Millie Perkins as the energetic and spirited Anne Frank. You completely sympathize with her curiosity and wonderment of her situation. Perkins delivers an all time great performance as Anne Frank. You believe her accent, sweet voice, mesmerizing eyes, and upset tantrums alike. She is compelling to the last. Anne's father Otto Frank is portrayed so beautifully by Joseph Schildkraut. His tender teachings and wisdom are much appreciated in this dour story. Schildkraut makes you care for the father as he had to be so supportive and strong for Anne and his family. He is certainly an empathetic character. Legendary actress Shelley Winters also gives a wonderful performance as Mrs. Van Daan. Her hysterics are fun as they are upsetting. Winters makes sure that even though you do not like her character as a person, she is also humanized as she reminisces about her loving youth. Winters brings so much depth to her characters and she is naturally interesting to watch in The Diary of Anne Frank. This is a classic film for its careful construction, beautiful artistry, standout performance from Millie Perkins, likable supporting cast, and timeless message of finding empathy for people in the worst situations. The harrowing story of Anne Frank is not easy to watch, but you should try to anyways as it will make you feel something real.

Movie name: The Diary of Anne Frank
Review: This movie recalls the real life events of Ann Frank. When Germany invaded Holland Anne Frank's family and another family movies into hiding because the Jews were being treated like second class citizens. During their stay Anne Frank wrote most of the events that happened in her diary which has become very famous today. The two families had to abide by strict conditions due to German soldiers standing guard till 6 in the evening. Tensions arise due to the lack of food and different opinions. My only problem with the move is that its running time is a bit too long.

Movie name: The Diary of Anne Frank
Review: Diary of Anne Frank It looks like a story that could be seen on a stage. All of the story takes place in one building all contained. I liked the music at the beginning of the first intermission. There is drama and heart in this story. Covers from 1942 when Anne gets a diary till the end of the war in Nazi Germany in 1945. They go stir crazy in a small portion of a factory. It is a film that would bore most kids. It is mostly talk and listening. Visually it is it very entertaining. I feel like it is a film you could mostly listen to and it is not always necessary to watch. This film could easily have been a radio show. This film is told quietly and in Black and white which I felt was appropriate for this film.

Review: Excellent movie of a Jewish family hiding from the Germans to escape life in a concentration camp.

Review: I personally have not seen the play yet but I will within the next 10 days. I just watched this film on a friday night and after reading the play, I can easily say it is well adapted. I personally love the style of the 1950s but think it fits perfectly with this story, too. Anne and the 8 others trying to be as hopeful and optimistic in a world of terror and death camps for anybody hitler didn't like, especially jews. I enjoyed it although it was very long and anne and peter look like 30 year olds, still great. just remember in your mind anne is 13, peter is 16, margot is 15 i believe all in 1942. I also must add the fact that this movie has great cinematography but lots of long dissolving shots. If you hate long transitions in large quantities you may get annoyed.

Movie name: Ben-Hur
Review: Un véritable tour de force ! Ben-Hur est un film intemporel, dont les effets spéciaux sont encore aujourd'hui remarquables. Si la longueur du film peut en rebuter certains, c'est par sa contemplation, ses dialogues et sa narration travaillée que Ben-Hur marque l'esprit. La distribution de 1959 nous donne la chance de voir réunis des acteurs aussi talentueux que Charlton Heston, Stephen Boyd, Haya Harareet, ou encore Hugh Griffith. Quelle présence à l'écran ! Rares sont les stars d'Hollywood possédant, de nos jours, un charisme comparable. La musique, qui oscille entre la douceur des scènes bibliques, et l'épique des scènes où les Romains sont présents, accompagnent et rythment parfaitement le film. Les bruitages, faut-il le souligner, sont pensés et adaptés. Par ailleurs, comment est-il possible d'émettre un avis sur Ben-Hur sans parler de sa course de chars ? Pour être honnête, je m'attendais à ce que cette course soit accompagnée d'une musique entraînante, montant crescendo… mais pas du tout ! Aucune musique n'est jouée ; se font seulement entendre le bruit des sabots, de la foule et le choc des chars. La scène est surréaliste, paradoxalement, tant par le réalisme de la représentation des divertissements antiques, que par les moyens humains et matériels qui ont été déployés pour la réaliser. En tant que téléspectateur, c'en est même difficile de se figurer le travail et la somme qu'une telle mise en scène nécessite. Les onze Oscars obtenus sont tout à fait mérités : Ben-Hur est un film incontournable pour les cinéphiles, encore plus pour les amateurs de péplum.

Movie name: Ben-Hur
Review: Man what a huge difference a devoted and frame by frame restoration can do for a film when it is viewed on Blu-ray, especially since "Ben-Hur" was filmed on 70mm film! The results of the video and audio (wisely spread across two 50 gigabyte Blu-rays to conserve the high bit rate) are truly astounding and this is one of the greatest catalog releases to date on the Blu-ray format! The film itself is a pure epic in scope religious themed action/drama film that is timeless and features many stunning and legendary scenes in cinema within it's nearly four hour running time. The film features a great cast headlined by the legendary Charlton Heston as Judah Ben-Hur. The film is filled with adventure and characters that are developed enough that you care about them and their fate as if they were real life friends or family. A bad series of events and a betrayal of a close friend set in work the fall and eventual rise of Judah to not only avenge himself but his mother and sister as well. "Ben-Hur" is a truly timeless film and it's larger than life sets, 100,000 costumes, and 8,000 extras are only part of what makes it so grand in scope. This is a film that everybody both young and old and religious or not should try and view and will be rewarded for their time! The film barely squeaked into the AFI Top 100 Films of all Time list at #100 but in my opinion should sit a little higher than it currently does.

Review: Watered down and ineffective.

Movie name: Sons and Lovers
Review: Sons and Lovers is a decent film. It is about a young man with artistic talent who lives in a close-knit, English coal-mining town during the early 20th century. Trevor Howard and Dean Stockwell give good performances. The screenplay is a little slow in places. Jack Cardiff did an alright job directing this movie. I liked this motion picture.

Movie name: Sons and Lovers
Review: Brilliant photography matches most all aspects of this timeless story

Movie name: Sons and Lovers
Review: Jack Cardiff's greatest achievements came as a cinematographer as he produced the timeless visuals present in Black Narcissus (1947) and The Red Shoes (1948). He doesn't have the abilities of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger as a director which hinders him in bringing D. H. Lawrence's classic novel of the same name to the screen. So much of the novel is the internal struggle of Paul Morel, better conveyed in writing than on screen, which means that it is harder to understand why this story is so captivating when on the surface so little happens. I didn't enjoy Ken Russell's Women in Love (1969) but I would call it superior to this film in that it is more willing to experiment and deviate from the text in what it portrays. Aspiring artist Paul Morel, Dean Stockwell, has an emotionally incestuous relationship with his mother Gertrude, Wendy Hiller, which is very different to the bond he shares with his abusive, alcoholic father Walter, Trevor Howard. He enters into a relationship with the sexually repressed Miriam Leivers, Heather Sears, that suffers under the weight of his unfulfilled sexual desires and the meddling of his jealous mother. Frustrated with Leivers, Morel begins sleeping with the sexually liberated feminist Clara Dawes, Mary Ure, who happens to be married. Dawes quickly recognizes the incestuous bond between Morel and his mother but has her own reservations about continuing the relationship due to the fact that she still loves her husband. When Gertrude falls ill Morel returns to her side and admits that he loves his mother more than he could love any other woman. After her death he resigns himself to a life of being a bachelor. The standout to come out of the film is Hiller who won an undeserved Academy Award for her performance in Separate Tables (1958) but proves she has real dramatic chops here. She delivers her comic, biting remarks intended to cut down the suitresses of her sons. There is a constant touch of sadness however as while she is able to exert control over her weak minded boys her husband proves harder to influence and the specter of physical and emotional abuse hangs over her character. Many of the characters are meant to believable as working class Britons and Hiller pulls of the accent and the manner better than anybody in the film as she reminded me of Edith Evans in Look Back in Anger (1959). Unfortunately the rest of the film is maudlin and mundane. Where the vivid emotions of Paul and his repressed desires are utterly compelling on the page it is difficult to understand why we should care so much about a young man who can't love two beautiful women because of his attachment to his mother the way this film tells it. I found myself bored by scenes that play out exhilaratingly in the book and while I looked forward to the scenes between Morel and Dawes I found myself let down. Stockwell and Ure give fine performances but both are forced to telegraph their emotions by a screenplay that prefers to tell instead of allowing the audience to be shown. The passion that Morel is transferring from his mother to this woman who is seemingly the complete opposite was never quite felt as there is little anger or desperation in this rendering of Morel and his tragic psyche is not very deeply explored. The lone Academy Award that this film won was for it's cinematography which I must recognize at being very good but when compared to Psycho (1960) and The Apartment (1960) it is hard to argue that it is deserving of this honor. We do get some beautiful images of Morel and Leivers frolicking in the evening light and the working class British atmosphere is captured nicely but nothing jumps out at you as being unique or special. Perhaps they wanted to acknowledge the film in some way as it was nominated for multiple major awards but I would have preferred to have seen Psycho (1960) or Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960) nominated for Best Picture as they have both had longer lasting legacies and are far more engaging, entertaining pictures worthy of note.

Review: If this movie had been made a few years later a lot more could have been done with the Lawrence book on which it is based. (His Lady Chatterly's Lover was being un-banned in England the year the film was released). For a story depicting a young man's struggles to feel comfortable in a relationship, the movie is mostly passionless - and that is what weighs it down. I would have put the father more into the background too (where he largely belongs) even though Trevor Howard gives a strong performance. Dean Stockwell is also good as Paul, conveying the intelligence and confidence yet confusion of the main character. Listen out in the score for a strange use of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, when the husband brings his wife a cup of tea to her in bed the morning after one of their rows. Or did my ears deceive me?

Review: I don't like that girl who played his young love, her mouth goes places when it opens.

Movie name: Sons and Lovers
Review: Victorian morality is pitted against teenage sexual urges in a small mining town. D.H. Lawrence's concentration on the decay of old sexual mores is on full display here, but unfortunately the depth of his characters is not. Miriam, as the film presents her, is thoroughly naive and uninteresting, and her third act scenes seem inconsistent considering all that has come before. I also thought the Oedipal relationship between Paul and Gertrude could have been more developed. We don't need to be pounded over the head with it, but the connection between Paul's sexuality and his devotion to his mother could have been more obvious. With no small contribution from the fantastic performance by young Dean Stockwell, Paul is the only character who is fleshed out and developed. In Stockwell's hands, Paul is what he is in the book, a man who is out of place and ahead of his time but confined by the morality of his place and time. Some of the scenes between Clara and Paul would have fallen flat in the hands of a lesser actor, but with Stockwell, never has a game of cribbage been so smoldering. Operating within the standards of the time, <i>Sons and Lovers</i> does its best to convey sexuality without the tired <i>Risky Business</i> trains-through-tunnels metaphor, but for once I found myself hoping for voice overs that could feature some of Lawrence's original language, so rich in feeling and sound. Overall, this version of <i>Sons and Lovers</i> is quite good, but if only we were able to transport the 1960 version of Dean Stockwell into today's time, I think we would have a better, immortalized look at Lawrence's masterpiece.

Review: I had to scrounge the UK Amazon site for a used copy of this and fight to watch it despite the region code... and it was worth the cost and effort! Why in heaven's name is a movie nominated for that many Oscars so hard to find? Ignore the 2003 remake. This is the stuff. The actors do D.H. Lawrence proud.

Movie name: Spartacus
Review: I am Spartacus. One of the all-time greats.

Movie name: Spartacus
Review: "Spartacus" finds a lot of (what we'd later discover were) Kubrick's trademarked abilities stymied by the last gasps of the studio era, but it's still fascinating to see how the man navigated through such daunting material in such a notoriously limiting period of film history. In many ways, I could see the argument of this being the biggest film he's made in terms of scope, storytelling and just how much effort went into everything in front of the camera. With regard to my enjoyment of the picture, though, I'm of two minds. The actual "Spartacus" stuff is magnificent. The character himself is just a blast to watch. Kirk Douglas is in top charismatic form here and all the battles are intoxicating as well, representing some of the only times we get a clear glimpse at an unmistakable Kubrick at work. The palace intrigue stuff was a bit more difficult for me to get into, ultimately leaving me thirsting for more swashbuckling. Still, it's hard to find the epic feel given off here in pretty much anything coming out in theaters these days and that made this worth the watch alone.

Review: One of the greatest epics of all time, and so underrated as a Stanley Kubrick masterpiece. This film is a hall of fame of acting; simply sublime ensemble cast. Very re-watchable, it has everything you want in a movie.

Movie name: Spartacus
Review: Classic .So good. I like the tv series but hated the Blood and Steal one was too updated!! Ridiculous making everyone in Ancient Rome look like animals. They could not build an empire like that. Classic one was the best well done. Shows the good and bad in Ancient Rome. But you can see the bad and the good of the great empire! And Glories. I am half Italians and all Southern Italian origins have so much Greek/Anatolian especially Sicilians going back to Ancient times that you just feel connected to the empire yes good great and the bad happen with villains and systems in every great empire or society.

Movie name: Spartacus
Review: The story in this movie is wonderful, it has very interesting characters and enemies. Very emotional, and the end is not expected but logical. To have this movie show the slaves winning and leaving Italy would just be inaccurate. The movie is long, but making it shorter would have spared the deep meaning and story.

Review: Great movie about arguably the greatest Bulgario to ever live.

Movie name: Spartacus
Review: This movie ended differently than I thought it would for a bit (in a very good and powerful way) and I liked the battle scene with the Romans and how it started, plus the famous "I'm Spartacus!" scene. The acting and dialogue were a bit outdated but it was very good for the time, and I can now finally see how so many films copied the material from this one (such as Gladiator and Braveheart). While I liked the 10 Commandments more and while this was an overly lengthy movie to watch, it remained impressive and I was hooked from the very beginning. It's important to watch older films that are actually original for the time that they came out, and Stanley Kubrick will always be the ultimate king of directing movies! RIP and RIP to everyone else who participated in this production.

Movie name: Spartacus
Review: "Spartacus" has that old-school epic feel that few films of today have. This is undoubtedly a long movie, but it tells a complete story. The production value is so impressive and even more so considering when it was made. I enjoyed the film's big moments and felt a bit hit or miss with its dialogue-heavy and talky moments. Sometimes I felt completely engaged and other times a bit bored. Nonetheless, the movie has plenty of entertainment value, particularly at the beginning and near the end which makes it a worthwhile experience. I also think the performances and characters are well thought out here and I really did feel immersed in the world it was wanting to create. Kirk Douglas gave a really memorable lead performance here and it carries the movie in any areas it may lack or feel dated. Overall, this is one of Kubrick's earliest big movies and it is a solid part of his diverse film library.

Movie name: Spartacus
Review: An instant classic film that had the opportunity to have one of the greatest movie endings of all time. They should have ended at I'M SPARTACUS.

Movie name: Spartacus
Review: This is a much underrated classic. First, the writing. It is excellent throughout. Yes, there is a lot of controversy as to whether Ustinov wrote his own dialogue and what role Kirk Douglas played in changing lines on set - that's all trivia. Dalton Trumbo wrote a great script. From the very outset, he knew he had to write a script where the title character was crucified at the end - and yet the movie had to 'uplifting.' He succeeded. The dynamic between the characters is always electrifying. And the love story - well, it is one of the best ever put on screen. Next, the acting - again, it doesn't get any better. From Douglas' teeth-grinding action scenes to Olivier's smooth but uncompromising Roman dictator-in-waiting to Jean Simmonds masterful performance of a slave woman searching for a way to be free, there are few movies that can boast the kind of top to bottom great acting that htis movie has. Then, the other parts that make a movie rise above the rest - starting with its director, Stanley Kubrick. This is an epic movie told at a persoanl level. Some of the scenes are so well staged ans hot that they take your breath away. Russell Metty doesn't have the reputation that some cinematographers have, but this movie shows what he could do when given the chance. Alex North's score is heralded as one of if the greatest score ever written for a film. Saul Bass did the credits and they are outstanding - yes, the credits are worth watching! See this movie - on a big screen if you can, but see it. It's one of the greatest movies evewr made. It's Spartacus!

Review: Released soon after Ben-Hur and telling a similar story, Spartacus is also a terrific movie whose action and cinematography have stood the test of time. Since this was the only Stanley Kubric movie where he didn't have complete control, he later disowned it - but it's a mark of his ridiculous levels that his discard bin contains a film like this.

Review: This classic war movie was spectacular. Kirk Douglas, Lawrence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, and the rest of the cast did a spectacular job in this movie. This true story about Spartacus, the man who fought against the Roman Empire was dramatic, intense, and inspirational. Spartacus was a very courageous man that wanted what is right for his people and do whatever it takes to get it. That's a true warrior. If you haven't seen this classic movie yet, check it out sometime. It's a definite must see.

Review: Chato e cansativo, bem chatinho, enfadonho, falta carisma aos personagens, falta um roteiro mais atraente, falta drama. A tradução do título em português é bem irônico, ''Desafio a corrupção'' uma vez que o protagonista é o típico malando, vagabundo, bêbado e que bate em mulheres, um retrato do típico orgulho masculino ferido, ambição desmedida e vício no jogo, nojento, repugnante, qual corrupção está desafiado, a não ser a de seu próprio caráter. Triste desfecho, insosso como todo resto, Chato

Review: Suckering the audience in with tension and a driven Paul Newman, The Hustler finds its groove in a slick mood and layered themes on the nature of winning.

Movie name: The Hustler
Review: I really like the black and white dramas from the 50s and 60s, so I don't know why it took me so long to get around to watching this one. I liked it well enough, although I would have preferred more hustling and pool and less of the love story.

Movie name: The Hustler
Review: Probably the greatest depiction of pool in a movie, not only because of its accuracy, but because it shifts towards a story so specific it opens the gates to treasures of drama. The performances are very convincing, and that includes the acting, the dialogue, the pool games in action, and everything else throughout. The Hustler was considered revolutionary in its time, but it still can be considered so today. It's a must-watch.

Movie name: The Hustler
Review: The Hustler isn't just one of, if not the single, greatest sports movies of all-time. It's just one of the great films ever made. Everything about this film is almost pitch perfect, from it's cinematography, it's tone, the direction, writing, acting, music, etc. Robert Rossen has made a certified classic and a movie that is must-watch for any cinephile at least once a year. The best part of this film, by far, are the performances. In a film that uses limited sets and usually filmed in dark and closed pool halls, it's up to the actors to be at the top of their game, and the main quartet are certainly that. Paul Newman gives a career best performance as "Fast" Eddie Felson, making the brash and headstrong pool shark a sympathetic character who goes through the entire gamut of emotions by the end of the film and has you questioning whether the end justifies the means. Piper Laurie as well, as Newman's counterpart and the one who quietly shapes everything about Eddie, is phenomenal as the equally flawed but equally sympathetic Sarah. She actually ends up with the most heart-wrenching and most important moments in the film, with her tender care for Eddie as he recovers from his injuries and her desperation and end thanks to a sleazy manager really hits hard. Of course, you have to focus as well on possibly the most underrated antagonist in film over the past 75 years in George C. Scott's Bert Gordon. There is nothing redeeming about Bert Gordon, nothing that makes a view think that maybe he's right in the end. He's greedy, slimy, manipulative, and only out for his own pocketbook. That point is never more clear than the sequence with Findlay (Murray Hamilton) in which he is able to anger Eddie enough to come back and win a substantial of money and then accosts Sarah and causes her demise. The slow diatribe that Eddie goes on throughout the climactic pool sequence going after Bert is cathartic not just for Eddie but the viewers as well. It's a well-written villain and Scott is perfectly sleazy for the role. If it wasn't for Patton, I'd say it was his best work. Finally with casting, we get to the mere presence that is Jackie Gleason. He's barely in the film, bookending the feature, but whenever he's on screen you can't look away. The big man dominates his screentime and is believable as the legendary shark Minnesota Fats. When he say "pay up" after being thoroughly defeated by Eddie, you feel for him, almost like he was just a slight speedbump for Eddie to drive over and get to his real target at this point, Bert. Technically, it's incredibly vivid to watch and the way the cinematographer and Robert Rossen use lighting and shade is immaculate. The closeups of Newman alone in the pool halls are worth the watch, but the standout sequence is the final scene of Sarah. You see her broken and at her end through a mirror. Scrawling "Perverted, Twisted, Crippled" in lipstick shows how dark the path Bert has led Eddie on and the next shot of Eddie discovering her and Bert claiming ignorance is profound. In the end, the Hustler is an incredible film experience and one that we can all learn from about the mentality of winning and whether we would take the steps to get to the point that we think we desire to reach. In the end, Paul Newman and "Fast" Eddie Felson is all of us. What good is reaching the mountaintop if all we did is lose ourselves and everything we love in the process?

Review: Great performances and a great and thought provoking script give moral weight to this film and the cast just gives a stellar performance all around. A telling tale of what arrogance and pride can do if you let it control you, no matter your skill or prowess.

Movie name: The Hustler
Review: Made during a period in Hollywood when it was just beginning to explore edgier themes, but saying "bastard" was still revolutionary. A well-written and excellently acted movie about a broken woman being unable to fix a broken man. A man obsessed with determining his own worth by how unbeatable he is at pool. Realizing far too late in life what was truly important to him. Selling out his soul to a person who thinks very little of him unless he is winning and earning money. That would've been enough for an amazing story, but it also tries to push through a very heavy-handed social hierarchy theme, which feels ridiculous when it's applied to something as benign as pool gambling. It's even more depressing when you consider that in the sequel decades later, it would turn out that Eddie, despite his defiance at the end, never managed to escape.

Movie name: The Hustler
Review: Characters galore and will spark a spirited debate of flaws and failures. Jackie Gleason's class and subtleness make this one of his best roles. Place close attention to George C. Scott's interaction with Piper Laurie. Short but extremely important.

Movie name: The Hustler
Review: Fast Eddie still playing but he digs deeper into grief, achieves a deceptive accommodation to his price in victory. Life or death is yet a another pocket number for Eddie's fast and loose derailment of Burt's threats supported by Fats fears of what is remembered.

Review: Real good . Just a great cast included

Movie name: The Hustler
Review: The late Paul Newman is quite the hustler Here he plays Eddie Felson, a pool shark going from one pool game to the next He confronts Minnesota Fats in his latest encounter which could be the toughest match he's faced Felson is a damaged man who fears winning as much as losing a game of pool This is just okay but Newman is amazing

Movie name: The Hustler
Review: My mother, aunt and I watched much, but not all of the movie, which was supposed to be a classic. Why? Basically, once Paul Newman gives up his former career to take up pool hustling, the movie slows to a crawl. We watch very long scenes of pool playing, very long scenes of him and his girlfriend...and everything moves so slowly, I lost interest and dozed off. The concept was good, but it needed more than long pool-playing sequences. The scenes continued longer than they needed to, and we never learn much about the protagonist or what motivates him to want to be a big-time pool hustler. We see what he does, but never come to learn why he is doing it. Disappointing.

Movie name: The Hustler
Review: Good flick. Great performances. If only it weren’t so damn boring.

Movie name: The Hustler
Review: Down in the dumps drama is realistically set and brilliantly photographed in sleazy pool halls, cheap hotels and worn-down bats and diners, where its downward spiraling tale seems all too inevitable; top performances all around, but Paul Newman is absolutely perfect in the title role.

Movie name: The Hustler
Review: Filmed in vivid black and white inside the confines of smokey, whiskey-soaked pool halls and grimy apartments, The Hustler tells the story of "Fast" Eddie Felson (Paul Newman), a smooth-talking pool shark looking for easy money and the glory of beating Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), the best player in America. The Hustler is a dark and gritty movie, where all of the characters are fueled by alcohol, nicotine, and hazy dreams of fame and fortune. For anyone who has any doubts about Newman's acting abilities, there is no need to look any further than his performance as "Fast" Eddie to dispel those doubts.

Review: I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but there are a few that I genuinely love. I enjoyed the original '61 film, but Spielberg's take is incredible and a must-see for anyone who enjoys film in general.

Review: Another mediocre ripoff of a classic. Unneeded and unwanted

Movie name: West Side Story
Review: I kept hearing about how amazing this is. While it's a fun enough update to the original, I just found it rather dull and over the top. Probably doesn't help that the two leads are insufferable...

Movie name: West Side Story
Review: You can’t improve on a classic. The audience numbers here are a bit nonsensical. None of the musical numbers were better just different. In fact, “America” from the ‘61 film is a battle song between the ladies who see the possibilities whereas the men see it for the reality they face. The original tries to make points, the 2021 version seems to be there just because it was in the original. “I feel pretty” was a great number, but not as goose bumpy and love sick as the ‘61 version. It was a little more down to earth which doesn’t convey the true 1st love crush that Maria experiences. Although the meeting of Maria & Tony seems a little more genuine when they end up behind the bleaches it seems to lose its magic & the first flame doesn’t seem to get lit. It’s like filming the live action version of the Lion King, was it really necessary? Nope.

Review: Embarrassingly, his last few movies made me forget how great of a filmmaker Spielberg is. The filmmaking here is top level. Besides that, I’m not sure if I’m just too jaded for this type of story or if the central romance didn’t work at all.

Review: This movie should not have been done. Nothing compared with the original, bad acting and singing, there is only one West Side Story

Movie name: West Side Story
Review: A remake of the 1961 musical of the same name, which follows a forbidden love affair against the backdrop of street gang rivalry in 1950’s Manhattan. Kinda dumb. They’re fighting, then they’re dancing. Somebody gets murdered, but they’re still singing. I can appreciate musicals for the production value and the performances, but they just don’t do anything for me. If you like musicals, I’m sure you will enjoy this one. Ariana DeBose’s performance is the highlight of the film. Expect big things from her.

Movie name: West Side Story
Review: Excellent rendition of the musical, adding topics like gentrification and transsexuality to the table, with a few passages of spoken lines in easy to understand Spanish language, all things we didn't have in the famous 1961 movie version. The music quality is top notch by the way and the camera work's great too.

Movie name: West Side Story
Review: Only for lovers of (the) old musical(s). Lots of good acting and singing. But most songs are clunky. The script is really weak in the first half. But if you started stay with it as the second half is better. Personally, I disliked the showy ultra high vocals by the two main actors. It seems the music might have been better served with lower voicings.

Movie name: West Side Story
Review: Big cinema! A worthy and deeply remake of the original. Genius film making, using shadows, camera, lighting, story telling foremost with songs at its service, amazing acting, in particular the star-making performance of Rachel Zegler. Movies of this quality are so rare these days.

Movie name: West Side Story
Review: Spielberg does the impossible here (make a great new film adaptation of a classic stage musical that already had a classic film adaptation) and nearly all of the changes/ updates work. Hell even some of the new stagings are even better here ("Cool" and "I Feel Pretty").

Movie name: West Side Story
Review: Steven Spielberg livens up his direction for this dazzling adaptation of the musical that sings passion and effort without resorting to the outright drab and melancholy aesthetic of many of the films that directors of his amount of fame and legacy often resort to eventually.

Movie name: West Side Story
Review: I didn't enjoy it. I enjoyed the skill of the dancers but feel there was too much of it. The dancing didn't seem connected to the plot, and came across as dancing just to dance. I also felt the rivalry and hatred between the two sides lacked believability. Throughout the film I could not accept any of it as either real or very entertaining. I never got the feeling that Tony and Maria were in love. Individually some of the acting was great, but in many scenes one actor would be wonderful but the other(s) in the scene were just reciting lines.

Review: It's one of the worst war movies I've ever seen, with imbecilic acting and exaggerated hysterical moments and scenes. I can't recommend it, but for anyone looking to watch a great war movie, just stop here and go watch 'Saving Private Ryan' instead.

Movie name: The Longest Day
Review: Stellar cast, they did their best in narrating one of the greatest events in human history in just 2 and a half hours. Great movie.

Movie name: The Longest Day
Review: It's historicity worked for me, but the major stars playing military leaders were stiff, often sounding like they were performing a one-act play to silent audiences. Nevertheless, it was worth watching it again.

Movie name: The Longest Day
Review: This is an absolute classic War movie. Yes, it is long but tells about the events of D Day from all perspectives. Steller cast. One thing I didn't know until recently and that is the part Richard Todd played of Major Howard and Pegusus bridge. Richard Todd was actually there alongside Major Howard when they took and held the two bridges.

Movie name: The Longest Day
Review: Great all star movie. While Saving Private Ryan has by far the best action scene of the landings (or maybe any battle scene), this old timer still reins for scope and retelling the story of the the Normandy Invasion.

Review: 1962 ! ALL STAR CAST of hunerts! 1962! I can't believe I've never seen it until not on the tv set, 7.26.22. Tho its been on TV a lot, i musta thot I'd seen it already, or could watch it the next time. Suffers from 1962 style and limitations. I learned that Theodore Roosevelt JR, was a leader in Utah Beach, (but died of a heart attack a mo later). Anyway, 5 RT stars, cuz a War movie classic, and D Day should never be forgot. They musta got real Germans to play the officers, cuz they sounded very German.

Movie name: The Longest Day
Review: The Longest Day is a little slow to start. However, once the ball gets rolling, this film features jaw-dropping battle sequences with very impressive action choreography and cinematography. And even though it features a host of popular actors of the time, there's no real star. Instead, the movie allows the story to be the focus, and invites you to think about all those who lost their lives while fighting for freedom on D-Day.

Movie name: The Longest Day
Review: The events of D-Day, told on a grand scale from both the Allied and German points of view is the focus of the film. The day after the film opened at the Warner Theatre in New York City, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times declared: "The total effect of the picture is that of a huge documentary report, adorned and colored by personal details that are thrilling, amusing, ironic, sad ... It is hard to think of a picture, aimed and constructed as this one was, doing any more or any better or leaving one feeling any more exposed to the horror of war as this one does". Variety described it as "a solid and stunning war epic" that "emerges as a sort of grand scale semi-fictionalized documentary concerning the overall logistics needed for this incredible invasion". Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called it "a tingling, eye-gripping, fantastic picture" that "must rank as the screen's most massive battle epic". His only criticism was "the lack of perspective in depicting the German belief that the Normandy landings might not have succeeded had Hitler not taken a sleeping pill ... 'The Longest Day' should have taken infinitely more care to put this German belief, however strongly held, into proper proportion". Brendan Gill of The New Yorker called the film "a tour de force of audio-visual verisimilitude," but confessed that "my emotions were hardly ever engaged, and I ended, rather to my embarrassment, by being bored". He went on, "Mr. Zanuck made it all the harder for me to take this mock-documentary seriously by stuffing it with innumerable celebrated actors, most of whom make such fugitive appearances that the audience finds itself engaged in a distracting game of instant identification". The Monthly Film Bulletin stated, "The Longest Day is a monument split down the middle by compromise. At its best, what comes across very strongly is the feeling of immense and careful organisation that went into the whole D-Day operation, the sheer crippling weight of noise, the simple fact that a lot of people died, and the sense of personal confusion and dismay of soldiers wandering alone through the countryside ... But the film is, first and foremost, a spectacle, and therefore it has stars—a multitude of them, often with barely a line to speak, and usually with no real part to play". This American epic war film, shot in black and white is based on Cornelius Ryan's 1959 non-fiction book of the same name about the D-Day landings at Normandy on June 6, 1944. This WWII film is a masterpiece in so many ways being made in 1962. Fantastic battle sequences set in Normandie and other real places, an amazing ensemble cast including John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Steve Forrest, Sean Connery, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Peter Lawford, Jeffrey Hunter, Rod Steiger, Gert Fröbe, Curd Jürgens, George Segal, Robert Wagner, Paul Anka etc, the different languages are intact in the film which is a big plus, great cinematography (the helicopter shots in the end of the film is fantastic) and with a general epic look and feel. The film won two Academy Awards and was nominated for three others. Twentieth Century-Fox was taking a gamble making this movie. At $10 million, it was a hugely daring venture, but even more risky was Cleopatra (1963), which was being filmed concurrently. This was to set Fox back the then unprecedented sum of $40 million. Although "Cleopatra " did well at the box office, it was simply too expensive to recoup its costs, and nearly bankrupted the studio. Fortunately, this movie turned out to be one of Fox's biggest hits and helped offset the financial damage caused by the other epic. Trivia: When cost overruns on Cleopatra (1963) threatened to force Twentieth Century-Fox to shut down production of this movie, producer Darryl F. Zanuck flew to New York City to save his project. After an impassioned speech to Fox's board, he regained control of the company he founded, ultimately finishing this movie and getting the production of "Cleopatra" under control. After he had spent the budgeted amount for "The Longest Day", he started using his own money to pay for the production. To create a more sympathetic stance to each of the different parties, producer Darryl F. Zanuck had Englishman Ken Annakin direct the British segments, the American parts were handled by American action specialist Andrew Marton, and German Bernhard Wicki took care of the scenes with the German Army officers. The film employed several Axis and Allied military consultants who had been actual participants on D-Day, and many had their roles re-enacted in the film.

Review: This war classic was very good. John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, and the rest of the cast did an excellent job in this movie. This true story about the invasion of Normandy, aka D-Day, was action-packed, intense, and incredible. It's one of the best war movies ever made and it was well written and directed. If you haven't seen this classic war movie yet, check it out sometime. It's a definite must see.

Review: The cast is immense as the movie one of the greatest war movies ever made

Movie name: The Longest Day
Review: Great, great WW2 movie. fantastic cast, adapted from the Cornelius Ryan book. Follows dozens of characters in the US, German, British, and French sides. The black and white is very effective. Henry Fonda and Robert Mitchum are great. John Wayne does a good job as his normal self. Sean Connery has a nice little part. Peter Lawford, Eddie Albert, Sal Mineo, Roddy McDowell, Richard Burton all have some good scenes. Jeffery Hunter is particularly effective as a grunt who is forced into a heroic act. The only negative, is 40 year old Red Buttons very poorly cast as a 20ish paratrooper who is in for some hammy comedy relief. That aside the movie does an excellent job showing the scope of the invasion and the confusion that ran rampant. Very highly recommended!

Review: Respectful and well made but I wish they fleshed out their characters better.

Movie name: The Longest Day
Review: An extraordinary feat from a technical perspective, with large-scale practical effects that put the film on a pedestal as the defining depiction of D-Day, particularly the beach landing scenes. While the story is relatively cohesive and the individual characters solid, The Longest Day is still, at its core, the victim of an incredibly outdated interpretation of the epic film: throwing 500 characters at the audience with a slight wafting of screen time each, such that you can hardly remember most of them. Throwing subtitles with names as if the audience could differentiate after a three hour run time is laughable, but the phenomenon is mitigated by the fact that most simply disappear from the narrative at some point. (3/5)

Review: 9.5/10 I have to watch this movie at least once a year. An all time classic.

Movie name: The Longest Day
Review: The war epic is a difficult genre to nail down as they tend to go in one of two different directions with bold anti-war art films like Apocalypse Now (1979) and mainstream films that glorify war like Patton (1970). This film falls into the second category as it is packed with stars, including John Wayne of the infamous The Green Berets (1968), and is heavy on the patriotism and light on the commentary on the damaging effects that war can have. With it's all male cast and almost three hour running time this film felt like a chore to watch and that meant that I was struggling to stay awake. The film follows the French, Americans, British and Germans as they prepare for D-Day and attempt to set up their troops so that they can defeat enemy forces in battle. The men face off on the battlefield and the Allies prevail with their victory serving as a testament to patriotism and the intelligence of their commanders. What takes you out of the film while also providing some interest amid the dreary discussions of battle strategy was the neverending parade of stars who pop up to play various significant historical figures. The issue is that we get so little time with them that it is hard to dissociate them from their public personas and believe them as men going into battle. With movie stars it does take a while to relax in their presence and begin to treat them not as the tabloid fodder we know them as but as whatever character they happen to be playing. When Sean Connery arrives on the beach in Normandy and announces that he is Irish despite having a thick Scottish accent we are aware that this is the man who has become famous playing James Bond and do not empathize with the very real dangers his character will face. It does not help that some of the performances in the film are truly awful with Wayne phoning it in by relying too much on his iconic voice and stature. Only Robert Mitchum and Henry Fonda deliver sensitive, natural performances as lifelong military men wary of facing off against such a well organized army. Whatever the various directors of the film were doing they certainly weren't focused on coaxing good performances out of their cast and seemed to be happy to let them rest on their laurels. The many different directors who had a hand in shaping this film also make it feel uneven and disjointed as much like How the West Was Won (1963) the film is episodic to the extreme. Yet it does not have the fun of that film as each section is full of clichés of the genre and the scenes of warfare quickly become monotonous. I felt only horror when the film wanted me to feel some deep sense of pride at the sight of young boys losing their lives at the hands of other men. The film never touches on the horrific actions that the Nazis are taking and most of the characters are driven by bloodlust and a vague sense of patriotism that is never entirely validated by the film. For the time the aerial sequences were probably impressive from a technical standpoint and the film did earn nominations in a lot of technical categories at the Academy Awards. Today, however most of the film's achievements have been eclipsed by later films like Saving Private Ryan (1998) leaving an empty film with little emotional appeal. Those who like this sort of big, jingoistic spectacle may take to the film but for a person like myself who does not see how anybody could love war and cannot stand watching it held up as something to marvel at it will disappoint. Going in, I had fairly low expectations but I did not expect the film to be quite so hard to get through. There needed to be something in the film that did not target specifically male audiences who thrill at the sight of violence and good old boys triumphing through use of weaponry. The film had a very narrow target audience and that audience happened to fit the demographic of most Academy members.

Review: The movie is long but does not feel like it since it's just a great tale

Movie name: Lawrence of Arabia
Review: 227 minutes of greatness! I've always wanted to watch 'Lawrence of Arabia' given its standing as being one of the greats, though that rather long run time always put it on my subconscious back-burner. At last, I rooted out some time for it and man it was a well spent near four hours! I'm not going to say its length is ignorable, though it truly doesn't feel like a 3hr 47min movie - so every credit to all involved. Peter O'Toole's performance is undoubtedly outstanding, I can't really add anything more to what I'm sure many, many others have noted down the decades - he is, put simply, brilliant. Other strong performers are Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif and, albeit more minorly, Claude Rains. No-one on the cast puts a foot wrong, as expected. The cinematography throughout is also absolutely exquisite, the entire look and feel of the film is just stunning. There is much more to say about this but I'll leave that to those that have already said such things. I'm just here to watch great movies and this 1962 picture is unequivocally one of those. Quite evidently a classic, no doubt about it.

Movie name: Lawrence of Arabia
Review: Wonderful cinematography, great sets and impressive action scenes. Worth watching for that alone. But the movie drags a little over it's huge runtime and seems to lack focus. The script was a bit on the theatrical side, especially later in the movie... the characters more focused on saying something profound than communicating. Also a pity they couldn't find Arabs to play all the Arab roles. Alec Guinness in particular was rather conspicuous. And the titular character was quite odd. Not sure what they were trying to say about Lawrence with Peter O'Tools muddled, half-bewildered interpretation. Probably no reflection of the historical person. Overall I loved the eye candy but not a huge fan of the character arc or story line.

Review: I recently found out about the good people at AMC Theaters have been releasing classics on the big screen. All my life i heard about peoples list of the best movies ever made. This movie was always on everyone's list. I finally saw it on the big screen at my local AMC Theater. AND OH MY GOD. i was not ready for how great this movie is. The score was awesome, so loud in AMC's awesome sound system. i could hear all the instruments playing. This is movie is old school, no CGI, no effects...the story was well told and i learned a lot about society and people from this movie. It really is one of the best movies ever made. the 4hrs went by so fast, i was so intrigued by it. Deff need to see it again to understand it more but highly recommend this movie to anyone who is curious about this era in cinema. I also recommend it to anyone who just wants to see a damn good movie.

Movie name: Hud
Review: One of the best more modern Western. Gritty, dirty and harsh. Hud is a bad man and there's no polishing him into anything nicer. Ends poetically and the drama in between seems to always teeter on the brink of personal self destruction before boiling over at one uneasy point. Watched on DVD.

Review: One of the greatest American movies.

Movie name: Hud
Review: Martin Ritt has a spotty record as a director. He never is able to start a picture well, dwelling on long shots of empty roads, rivers, or landscape. In the case, however, this approach works as the film explores a character without no redeeming graces. Hud violates every principle of common behavior, lying, cheating, stealing, raping and draft dodging (the final straw to Lonnie's break with him). Paul Newman's performance is perfect, making this odious person attractive. He drives off everyone. James Wong Howe's cinematography is not only excellent, it is glorious, winning him an well-deserved Oscar. I would go so far as to say that this is Ritt's only great film.

Review: The movie takes about an hour to really get into motion and once it does its just great.

Movie name: Hud
Review: An incredibly effective coming-of-age story that, contrary to the title, focuses not on Hud but on his nephew. The moral dilemma of choosing to be like his honorable, scrupulous, hardworking grandfather or choosing to be like his opportunistic, hedonistic, self-serving uncle is the bedrock of Lonnie's story. You feel the alluring pull of Hud's lifestyle, bolstered by the hallmark charisma of Paul Newman. A highlight of this film is the question of how to deal with cattle potentially affected with mad cow disease. It culminates in a heartwrenching sequence that truly allows the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography to shine. It's also critical to highlight Patricia Neal, who plays the housekeeper Alma. She is absolutely magnetic in this role. Every movement, every word, and every look is infectiously natural. The life she imbues the story and the tragedy of her character are real stand-outs in a film already chock-full of amazing elements. She's the temptation to give this a full five.

Movie name: Hud
Review: Possible Spoilers Hud is a good film. Not only does Paul Newman give a good performance, but so does the supporting cast. Either you will get into the story or you won't. I thought this was much better than similar films like The Last Picture Show. The only things I didn't like was the lack of a good soundtrack and the unrealistic way the characters reacted to the old man dying (and the convenient and somewhat cheesy way it happened). Outside of that, good film!!!

Movie name: Hud
Review: Seeing the varying interpretations of Hud as a character really is interesting; some consider him a modern interpretation of the loner cowboy individualist whose blunt forthrightness makes him an admirable individualist, while to others he's just an asshole. While Hud may be viewed as just another take on the rebellious loner archetype (but in a neo-Western setting), the film is more complex than that. A surprisingly dark take on life's changes and mortality, Hud reconsiders the independent-minded lead in the context of a greater community and a full lifetime rather than in a traditional episodic Western context. Newman's Hud is outwardly charming but self-serving, abrasive, unrepentant, and willing to put others at risk for his own benefit. These traits lead him to be ostracized by those who know him and make him anything but sympathetic, even if there is some understanding in how the cold lifestyle that his family lives could have made him this way. Beautifully shot by Howe and well-acted, Hud is still solid viewing if intermittently somewhat confused as to its objective meaning. (4/5)

Movie name: Hud
Review: Of its time, well photographed and giving a glimpse of the hard life in the Texan panhandle. HUD would've seemed a reprobate to my parents generation . My father b 1922 mother b 1926. But sixties generation (me) were accepting a more selfish, self determined and hedonistic way of life compared to my father and mother, and HUD was an antihero popular like James Dean and Elvis. So the film probably has a different feeling depending on what your moral values are. But it's good, superbly acted, not much of a plot though.

Movie name: Hud
Review: A story as old as Cain and Abel, brought to life by Newman and an aging Melvin Douglas, Homer, a God-fearing, decent, salt-of-the-earth type, has literally "raised Cain" in the form of his younger son, Hud, a moniker that one presumes is short for "Hudson." He's poured his entire life into building a ranch and livestock on the unforgiving Texas prairie. He's seen hard times waging a battle against the vagaries of nature, but nothing has ever taken so much of a toll on him as has the loss of his elder son, and his grandson by that son is constant reminder of his loss. It's made worse by the apparent lack of remorse of the man responsible, none other than Hud, who, in Homer's words has "no check on his appetites" for women, booze, or violence. Homer is committed to a way of life that's dying, as oil rigs spring up on ranch land all around him. Hud wants no part of that life, but stays on merely out of a sense of obligation. The moral conflict between the two men, and the grandson's need to decide which is the proper role model, makes up the central theme of the film. Yes, the ending is morally ambiguous, but so are the life experiences of most of us.

Movie name: Hud
Review: Watched this last night. It really was brilliant with messaging on the the value of moral fibre. Although dated 1963?, it was powerful and heart warming. Sad at times, even made me cry (very unusual)

Movie name: Hud
Review: Paul Newman's revisionist Western Hud is a pretty stunning piece of Americana. Martin Ritt's Western drama Hud (1963) is shocking even now. Morality is tested by Paul Newman's villain Hud Bannon. Newman is fascinating as a cold, greedy, selfish cad going about town doing married women, starting fights, and drinking himself into a mean drunken stupor. Hud is Paul Newman without his natural charm and casual coolness. Hud is an atrocity of inconsiderate callousness, emotional repression, and brutal nonchalance like only Paul Newman could pull off. Martin Ritt takes you on a journey into despicable men abusing their status as a landowner with alcohol and cruelty. Melvyn Doulgas is excellent and moving as Homer Bannon, the moral father figure to Paul Newman's bad man Hud Bannon. You see his devastated look of loss when he gazes at his lost cattle, but his disappointment in his son Hud is all too apparent on his destroyed face. Patricia Neal is outstanding as Alma Brown, the poor housemaid getting hit on by Hud until a shocking rape attempt from Hud. Neal is charming and likable as the hard working woman that must have resonated with many ladies viewing Hud for the first time. She's as real as it gets with her warm and endearing performance as Alma in Hud. Brandon De Wilde is great as the sincere kid Lon Bannon, who looks up to Newman's lecherous Hud. You see his young man Lon go from eager to hanging out with his hero Hud to being repulsed by Hud's very presence as he witnesses Hud's wicked behavior and temper. Larry McMurty's story about a drunken son, estranged from his father for his wretched past and miserable future, finding everyone abandoning him as he's left alone is simply fantastic writing. Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr.'s script is full of heartfelt understanding of toxic masculinity and how selfish men undo themselves with their own cruel choices, mean words, and vicious actions. You understand Hud is no Western hero, but a true American capitalist nightmare thinking only of his own money and satisfaction. He's a straight up attempted rapist and a philanderer with other mens' wives. He even accidently got his own brother and father killed by the end of Hud. It's fitting he's lonely and alone in the quiet finale. James Wong Howe's black and white cinematography really takes into account Texas' wide open fields for the wide shots and isolating farmhouses. His camerawork feels distinctly sleek for this gritty piece of Americana. His choices of keeping the camera around a medium shot to see actors' reactions as well as the person speaking is very engaging for a drama. You know you're watching a Western when it's 112 minutes long, but Frank Bracht's editing and steady pace keeps things moving. Martin Ritt crafted a seriously gripping drama with Hud. Elmer Bernstein's light score is pleasant and moody with a resounding openness. His quiet accompaniment is a beautiful touch to Hud's harst demeanor. Sam Comer and Robert R. Benson's set decoration makes Texas look like an empty wasteland with no culture and few furnishings. Edith Head's outfits are fittingly simplistic, realistic, and stylishly cowboy to the core. In conclusion, Hud still works to shock the audience into the depths of depravity and irredeemable attitude of Paul Newman's Western antihero.

Movie name: Hud
Review: This Hud character seems like he's got a lot of backed up problems in his life that he keeps bottled up. He seems to be pretty reckless and does whatever he wants; having affairs with all the different women in town. It's only a matter of time until everything blows up in his face. God damn, I wish I had the build of Paul Newman. That Alma is one little tease of a firecracker. Hud's dad definitely has a lot of truth in what he told Hud. He doesn't care about anything, doesn't care about anyone but himself. Wow, that scene where Hud tries to have his drunken way with Alma was filmed very realistically. It was really uncomfortable watching that but damn the acting was on another level during that scene. Pretty damn dark how they had to coral all the cows in the pit and shoot them all. I can't help but be reminded of the Holocaust. I can't help but feel like the killing of the cows is kind of like a metaphor for the dying of tradition, grandfather's tradition. And with that, the death in a way of the old man. Hud's the kind of person you wish you could be but end up being more satisfied and happy when you don't become a person like him. This movie ended up being a pretty realistic drama with some touches of good humor. But in the end, it ended up being a pretty raw and almost sobering look at life and family. I thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a few things from it. I'd watch it again.

Movie name: Hud
Review: Hud, based on Larry McMurtry's novel Horseman, Pass By, is the simple story of three generations of Bannon men (Paul Newman, Melvyn Douglas, Brandon de Wilde) struggling to operate a cattle ranch in west Texas. The film focuses on their struggle to manage simmering family hostilities and conflicting values. The movie is more concerned with its characters than with plot and is aided by tour-de-force performances from the entire cast, including Patricia Neal's Oscar-winning performance as Alma, the housekeeper who manages to keep the men at arm's length. The stark black and white cinematography allows the viewer to seemingly taste the Texas dust and feel the heat of the sun on the back of the neck.

Movie name: Hud
Review: Hud is the type of movie that I would typically dislike, because the titular character is a jerk who seems to thrive on making the lives of others miserable. There’s an unrepentant quality to Hud that I would have struggled with if it weren’t for the fact that he is surrounded by people who serve as a stark contrast to his laissez-faire attitude. I was enthralled by the growing conflict between father and son, and always wanted more information. I think what was most fascinating about their relationship was that I sensed some underlying respect and affection that neither one could admit. In the hands of a lesser actor, I’m sure Hud’s animosity for his father would be unpleasant and 100% contentious, but Paul Newman is able to add subtext that makes you wonder if they could reconcile. The entire cast is superb in Hud. Melvyn Douglas has just as much nuance in his portrayal of Homer, so you also see more from him than just a self-righteous frustration with his son. Patricia Neal was a delight, as well, playing the tough-as-nails housekeeper. However, Brandon De Wilde played the most fascinating character in Hud, young Lonnie. We go on this exploratory journey with him to discover who is in the right between his uncle and grandfather, and who he will grow up to emulate. You can see his respect and a close bond with both, and we are left to wonder which way his future will lead him. The ending of that story was powerful, even if I felt like we were still left hanging on the fate of Hud. I did struggle a little with some of the things depicted in Hud, because the main character is so unpleasant, and his actions get quite detestable. It also didn’t offer the kind of resolution to the drama that I would have liked. However, despite the little things that bothered me, I was completely drawn into Hud in a way that only the best Westerns have achieved. The visuals captivated me to the point where I was actually looking for symbolism and metaphor in the staging and shot selection, and I’m normally oblivious to those details. That tells me there is something special going on in Hud.

Review: The performances along with a different take on western life make it work.

Movie name: Hud
Review: Probably my favorite portrayal by Paul Newman. Touching and thought provoking character study. This film is a sleeper, I happened to catch it on latenight television one evening and probably would never have seen it otherwise. If you enjoy serious dramas with deeper messages about family and human relationships, you're sure to dig this film. As beautiful for the visual depiction of rural life in the early 1960s as it is for its depiction of the dynamics between its flawed and multi-faceted characters.

Movie name: Hud
Review: Paul Newman has never been my favorite actor as I am not impressed by his work in The Sting (1973), Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and Mr. and Mrs. Bridge (1990) but he does a decent job here as the amoral Hud Bannon. The film as a whole has that lovely slice of life feel as it is based on a Larry McMurtry novel and his work served as the basis for The Last Picture Show (1971) and Terms of Endearment (1983). It's a really wonderful film and it has aged much better than a lot of the films produced in the early 1960s therefore it is worth a viewing. Arrogant, womanizing rancher Hud Bannon, Paul Newman, has a bad reputation in his small town as he regularly drinks and has a bad relationship with his father Homer, Melvyn Douglas, who is deeply principled. Caught in between the two of them is the orphaned Lonnie, Brandon DeWilde, who admires his uncle Hud for his seemingly glamorous lifestyle but feels a deep loyalty to his grandfather. Hud also pursues his father's flirtatious housekeeper Alma, Patricia Neal, who resists his affections because she is afraid of him hurting her. Meanwhile foot-and-mouth disease breaks out among the cows owned by Homer which forces him to execute all of them. The relationship between Hud and his father continues to deteriorate as time goes on and when he attempts to sexually assault Alma he isolates everybody around him. The film is special in that it manages to capture the atmosphere of small town Texas with immediacy and detail. We are greeted immediately with the sight of a tall, skinny man walking around a mostly deserted town in a cowboy hat. The wide roads and ornate storefronts reminded me of how Anarene, Texas was presented in The Last Picture Show but here it feels even sadder because only one of our main characters is a teenager while our other main character is an older man who acts like a teenager. The sweeping shots of the farm landscape are also impressive as they feel reminiscent of later John Ford films with a lone male figure cutting a strong shape against an unforgiving landscape. Cinematographer James Wong Howe also worked on The Rose Tattoo (1955), which I was not so hot on, and I would say he does markedly better work here as he builds an environment that feels utterly ruthless for these often vicious, weathered characters to interact in. Douglas gives the performance of a lifetime as the stoic, disappointed patriarch of a family in conflict who feels the west changing. He does more than just convey an intense and painful hatred for his immoral son as we see a man whose life has been defined by his morals have everything he has worked for taken away from him. He delivers several long, winding monologues that would feel stagey or over the top in the hands of a lesser actor but Douglas imbues the lines he delivers with a passion and an emotionality that leaves us with no doubt as to how his character feels without ever making us feel we are being preached to or exposited at as an audience. I can completely understand why he won an Academy Award for his performance as he is inarguably the best part of the film and lends some much needed gravitas to a film where the presence of his character needs to hang over our anti-hero throughout. What surprised me in terms of Academy Award wins was that Neal was not only nominated for an Academy Award but nominated in the Best Actress category when she appears on screen for just 22 minutes and isn't all that impressive. This is not to say that she isn't perfectly fine in her role as she is convincing as a simultaneously flirtatious and guarded older woman who protects herself from a man who will prove to be predatory. She gets the twang right and the chemistry is there between herself and Newman but both actors are completely overshadowed by the towering presence that is Douglas and Neal never really shines. I would have given the Best Actress award to Rachel Roberts for her performance as an emotionally fraught widow in This Sporting Life (1963). I would recommend watching this film even if only for the incredible performance from Melvyn Douglas and the cinematography.

Movie name: Cleopatra
Review: This movies problems and highlights can be summed up from one scene. The one where Cleopatra enters Rome. The scope, production value and special effects are amazing with good music to back it up as well. You feel the epicness. However as it keeps going 6-7 minutes strong you feel the problems start to seep in. This film loves to be self indulgent and bloated at times. Most of the acting say 70% of it is emotionless boring plot expose which is a HUGE amount for a 4 hour movie. Scenes go on way way way way too long. The pacing is the worst part of this film. It is bad. This shouldn't be 4 hours. Scenes that could be 90 seconds end up being 10 minute juggernauts weighed down by rambling plot expose and while the sets are lavish they aren't enough to offset the lack of epicness needed to justify holding on scenes for such a long time. A lot of this movie actually isn't that epic but more lavish. Overall it's disappointing to say the cinematography is just ok honestly. The other issue is the editing which is okay enough but needed more refinement. This feels like a Love Triangle/Love Tragedy mixed with a Historical Drama. Not a Biopic. Half this film Cleopatra isn't even the main focus. We never see her develop from a child to a young ruler which makes it hard to feel anything for her. Julius Cesar honestly has more focus in the first half surprisingly than anyone else and all his scenes are just boring plot expose constantly. Also, we learn more about the culture of Rome than we do the culture of Egypt which was a huge disappointment. I'm sure that was because many epics around this time focused on Rome but still. This needed to focus more on the life of Cleopatra and show her rise rather than part of a love triangle. It really feels like this is a film where Cleopatra is the Liaison for historical events. Not the main focus. This is why the 2nd half is better aside from the cool ship fight. It focuses more on Cleopatra and her ambitions. Not Romes. Also this needed much more narration montages to cut the run time down as well. I can't really recommend to anyone except die hard Taylor/Burton fans. There's enough here where I can't call this a bad film but it definitely isn't good and it's one of the most disappointing ones for sure.

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: Movie hits many different nodes and thats what makes it special.

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: In direct contrast to the book, The Life and Times of Alexis Zorba, the movie is extremely misogynistic, needlessly cruel, and tediously paced. The villagers are depicted as unimaginable monsters - unprincipled, shameless villains, without morals or character. Extremely disappointing, as a whole; it should never have won an Academy Award, let alone three. To add insult to injury, Rotten Tomatoes bestowed favorable ratings, which brings into question your seemingly biased process. Given the opportunity to rate Rotten Tomatoes, I would unequivocally say you're an unreliable source for entertainment seekers - two thumbs down. 👎 👎

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: "A man needs a little madness, or else he never dares cut the rope, and be free." This movie has a very fitting title, because it begins and ends with Anthony Quinn's main character. Attracting massive acclaim upon release and still considered among the actor's most significant performances, Zorba (the character) comes to life as an individual filled with a hearty love of life, making grand plans that ultimately fail or never live up to expectations before reinvigorating himself with more loud talk, drinking, dancing, and once again making plans. He's displayed as not entirely a virtuous figure, being often unreliable or untrustworthy in his ultimate pursuit of a well-lived life, but with a core of infectious vitality that ultimately sees him through virtually all hardships, totally immune to the reality around him. Quinn really eats up the role, throwing plenty of energy into his performance and demanding the audience's attention whenever he appears. The rest of the film is really just set dressing for Zorba, including Alan Bates as Basil, Zorba's uptight supposed behavioral foil that never offers any real contrast. There are subplots in the village (in particular a widow that falls for Basil and is ultimately murdered when she does not accept a local boy as her husband before he kills himself) that don't really feel particularly thematically hefty or relevant, they just offer a glimpse into a natural brutality and coldness that supposedly substantiates Zorba's boisterous way of life by contrast, but it doesn't really hold up to scrutiny. You don't have to be either a happy-go-lucky layabout or a cruel traditionalist. There is a happy medium that the film overlooks. Worth a watch for Quinn alone, but also a surprisingly cutting scene where a woman finds her house being looted down to the shutters at the moment of her death. (3.5/5)

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: This movie has not held up well. Although Anthony Quinn's performance is excellent, the level of cruelty and misogyny in the film are horrifying! The villagers in the town the main characters move to are portrayed as amoral primitives and there's a very disturbing murder. What little I'd heard about the movie made it sound like a somewhat light hearted film about a Greek man teaching a British man to be less uptight, but it's much darker than that.

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: I went on holiday in Crete in 2021 and decided to see Zorba the Greek However, the movie has nothing to do with the Crete of today. There are no tourists in Mihalis Kakogiannis's adaptation of the novel with the same name, no beautiful landscape and almost no feeling of the dramatic, even stunning landscape of Crete. In fact, the movie is about a wild, uncivilised, rural, backward Crete. Anthony Quinn is simply magnific and the film is worth watching only for his performance, which I dare to say it is one of the best I have ever seen in any movie ever. Everything is beautiful shot, the plot develops nicely, the actors and the action is vivid and convincing. The movie diverges from the book in one, perhaps essential, detail. One of the main characters, the one who comes to Crete to revive the lignite mine as a hero full of good intentions and care for the locals is not a young Greek intelectual but a British one. From the perspective of our time this is a twist that turns the movie from what could have been a commentary about modernisation, traditions and rural/urban gaps in Greece to a neo-colonial narative about a civilised Westerner wanting to and ultimately failing to modernise a backward place. The director, even if Greek himself, does not care to look closer and to understand or perhaps only to give the point of view of the locals about their traditional habits, religion, actions. The camera lens are in fact a pair of Western eyes looking at everything with curiosity, sometimes with repugnance, sometimes with patronising understanding. Women are there just for love affairs, household chores and stealing. Men are cruel, heavy drinkers, weak and lazy. Maybe they are, maybe they have always been like this. The problem is not the historical veridicity but the striking lack of interest in the local culture from a Greek director of a film ultimately about Crete. The movie is well worth watching but not to understand or to accompany your holiday in Greece.

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: The movie has been panned by critic Wendy Michener, as it "leaves too much to be explained". Perhaps, like Zorba's "clever people", she "weighs too much". I have only glanced at a few lines of the book, and it seemed too slight to construct a great movie upon, despite the brilliance of script, performances, and the central idea of ZTG (not at all bohemian, even in 1964) that human life is also a struggle to force meaning upon it. I've seen play this live, 3 times, and neither the play or his personality seem to keep up with that one electric performance. However, I think I will permit this adaption to be great, if barely. As for his lineage, that would be 1/2 Irish (that's what I said), and a mother of Mexican/Native Indian composition. No wonder he was type cast to so many "ethnic" parts. For the flip failure of his career, I suggest The Shoes of the Fisherman; I preferred him saving a tentative English writer to the entire planet, as a highly implausible pope.

Review: The story is nothing special and didn't give the actors much to do.

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: A film that is possibly most famous for it's final scene in which a lively Anthony Quinn teaches a typically surly Alan Bates how to dance I found this film much darker than I had thought it would be. My expectations of the film were much lower than they probably should have been as many of the acclaimed 1960s comedies I have seen were disappointing. Tom Jones (1963) felt overlong and gimmicky and Dr. Strangelove (1964) is one of those films that everybody hails as a masterpiece but I found myself disliking. This is not a great film by any means and it is far too long for what it wants to say but it is a more entertaining presentation of ostentatious Greeks who border on stereotypes than those that appeared in the prostitute centered comedy Never on Sunday (1960) which was just too much for my tastes. Stuffy English writer Basil, Alan Bates, meets the flamboyant Zorba, Anthony Quinn, while traveling to Crete by boat and agrees to bring him along to the house that his family owned because he can help him reopen a mine. Zorba initially finds it hard to open the mine but through some ingenious thinking he finds success and the two men meet the Widow, Irene Papas, who falls in love with Basil. This is an issue because she is betrothed to another man and when the affair between Basil and the Widow is discovered the man commits suicide. Meanwhile Zorba leads on the older Madame Hortense, Lila Kedrova, while romancing other women and spending Basil's money without care. The Widow is later murdered by the townspeople despite Zorba's efforts to stop this from occurring and due to Basil telling Hortense that Zorba wants to marry her he is trapped in a bind. He eventually marries her but is disappointed by the selfish actions of the townspeople after her untimely death. Kedrova was the only person to earn an Academy Award for her performance in the film and I assume this was largely based on the fact that she plays the most sympathetic character in the film. When her room is raided in the wake of her tragic death it is hard not to feel an outpouring of emotion but Kedrova's performance before this highly emotional scene leaves something to be desired. She is funny as the clingy girlfriend who hangs on to the womanizing Zorba but she is largely one note and does not bring the level of complexity to the role that an actress like Simone Signoret could have brought. The film, like Zorba, seems to be humoring her and we are never actually asked to understand her perspective or treat her as more than comic relief before her death. She did not have the strongest competition this year but her performance is competent if not spectacular. There is also the fact that the film just sort of drifts through scenes with no real sense of direction and very low stakes for the two main characters. Basil is a sweet, timid young man who will lose nothing by leaving Greece and gains little by being there. His relationship with the widow has tragic consequences but this has little effect on him and life goes on as it always has been. Zorba is even more nonplussed by everything he encounters as he is so louche and relaxed that we feel no tension when his wife dies or the timber transporter he designs fails. This is a problem when you make a two and a half hour film and one wonders why Cacoyannis could not have made the film much shorter. Never on Sunday was a film with many flaws but Jules Dassin was working with a slight story and knew it so he was smart to keep his film close to a tight ninety minutes. The undeniably pleasurable final scene in which the two men dance together redeems the film just a little as it becomes the fun romp it always should have been. It is unsurprising that this is the most memorable scene in the film and when people imagine the movie they think back to the dancing and not the grief and misery.

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: Well done and still entertaining, even if dated. I will commit the crime of admitting Quinn is good, but it would have been better with another actor. Quinn plays most things pretty much the same, and he never convinces me he’s anything but Hispanic, in anything.

Review: The best inspiring movie ever made!

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: Character interactions don't make any sense, some of such characters don't even have a reason to exist in the narrative, the titular character is an irresponsible and unlikeable douche, paints a very unlikeable image of the people of Crete and I'm still trying to understand what is supposed to be the message of the story. Garbage that is hailed as a classic.

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: Anthony Quinn really makes Nikos Kazantzakis' character of Zorba come to life, turning in a fantastic performance, and conveying Zorba's philosophy of living life to the full, of dancing and laughing in not just moments of joy or success, but also those of tragedy or failure. The book is a masterpiece, and while the movie doesn't (or perhaps can't) get quite as deep, Michael Cacoyannis (producer/director/screenwriter) certainly does it justice, shooting on location in Crete, capturing beautiful images and an authenticity in his film, and letting Quinn shine. We're given a wonderful philosophy in this gruff character who eschews pretense, book learning, rational analysis, religion, and nationalism. He is at once both hedonistic and simple, and also profound and deep, having gone beyond all theories and frameworks while living his life with a kind of purity. Zorba grabs us from the beginning, asking an Englishman (Alan Bates) "Will no man ever do something without a 'why?' Just like that, for the hell of it?" as they await their ferry, and then quickly sizing him up by saying "You think too much, that is your trouble. Clever people and grocers, they weigh everything." There is a challenge to rationality and convention here, and while the Englishman hires Zorba, it's clear that Zorba will be the one doing the mentoring, on how to live. A part of this is in nudging him into pursuing women, which Zorba does with relish. Aside from his ribald moments, there are others which are pretty risqué, including an old widow (Lila Kedrova) recalling an evening she spent with four admirals, and making it clear they all had sex together after a champagne bath. There are two very disturbing scenes in the film, one of which is when a young woman (Irene Papas) a man has killed himself over is surrounded by the townsfolk, stoned, and then killed. It's truly horrifying, and even if we can 'accept' it as an honest portrayal of old-world culture (though she's not guilty of anything!), the fact that her death means nothing to the two principal characters, the Englishman especially, doesn't seem genuine. Regardless, it's very difficult to watch. Later, the instant an old woman dies, her home is ransacked and looted, in another ugly mob scene. It's as if Cacoyannis is emphasizing how primitive Crete is, and juxtaposing this with Zorba's primitive (though enlightened) philosophy. This is consistent with Kazantzakis' writing in the novel, as well as in 'Freedom or Death'. There is a ruggedness in the people, as rugged as Crete itself, and if you're sensitive to that or behavior which is far from politically correct, you may not like the film as much. A couple more quotes: On aging: "They say that age kills the fire inside of a man, that he hears death coming. He opens the door and says, 'Come in. Give me rest.' That is a pack of old damn lies! I've got enough fight in me to devour the world. So I fight." On being irrational: "A man needs a little madness, or else he never dares cut the rope and be free." On war: I have done things for my country that would make your hair stand. I have killed, burned villages, raped women. And why? Because they were Turks or Bulgarians. That's the rotten damn fool I was. Now I look at a man, any man, and I say, 'He is good. He is bad.' What do I care if he's Greek or Turk? As I get older, I swear by the bread I eat. I even stop asking that. Good or bad, what is the difference? They all end up the same way...food for worms."

Review: Great characters! Lila Kedrova is magnificent!!!!

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: Truly one of my favorie films of all time. Anthony Quinn as Zorba is absolutely superb. And, the rest of the cast rings true in each scene. I never tire of watching this honest, raw film because each character as well as the townspeople engross me in the stoy --- from start to finish of the film. Throughout the journey, Zorba tells Basil (played perfectly by Alan Bates) his life's philosophy as he himself has lived it --- clearly, to the fullest. Whereas, Basil, the squeamish, uptght, overly shy Anglo-Greek visitor to Crete, is repeatedly stunned by the seemilgly backward, often unkind actions of the townspeople. Basil has in tow a few hundred books he has read on philosophy and other learned subjects, which seem to be of little use to him in living in the "real" world. This truth is pointed out on several occasions by Zorba -- In a kind but firm manner. It is a wonderful film in so many ways as it doesn't place blame or kudos on anyone for the simple matter that we are all humas. We are both generous yet deeply affected by the culture we are born to. Zorba seems the most likely to never sit in judgment of those around him or himself for the frailty of humanity. My favorite line in the film is when Basil asks Zorba if he is married. Zorba replies, "Am I not a man? And, does not a man marry? I have a wife, children and a house! The FULL CATASTROPHE!!"

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: Strong in both, direction and writing, this Greek comedic drama is a touching-yet-funny enough to captivate purists with the presence of its two lead roles and their particular but effective chemistry; Anthony Quinn and Alan Bates, not to mention its great locations and unique use of symbolisms towards the use of character development and sympathetic moments, making it a pleasant experience for fans of foreign productions.

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: A black and white classic that remains as relevant and entertaining as ever. Quinn essays the titular role, as Zorba encourages a live-for-today mentality, with dance sometimes the only answer to life's inevitable downturns.

Movie name: Zorba the Greek
Review: "A man has to be a little crazy, otherwise he will never dare to let go and be free." Zorba. Reviewing "Zorba" is always a pleasurable invitation. Personally, it is a film that brings back several memories of the most diverse phases of my life. The most admirable thing about the film is its simplicity inherited from neo-realism, something almost impossible to see in today's cinema, and probably by the characteristics of our individualistic generation. The paradox in "Zorba" is in its simplicity traits that gain a splendid dimension. Everything is so well done that even slips end up being irrelevant, though they exist. The film's occasional mistakes may be characterized by the adaptive relationship of Nikos Kazantzakis's novel with the script and direction signed by Michael Cacoyannis. By fragmenting a moment of life between the meeting of the young Basil (Alan Bates) with Zorba (Anthony Quinn) through the relations of work, companionship and ending with the farewell of these friends, we have in this fragment of moments, insertions in style of chronicles of the Life that do not always punctuate or construct relations, besides, by centralizing the film in relaunching between these two friends, we lose, and in total merit by the artistic and interpretative quality, very interesting figures like the brilliant Madame Hortense (Lila Kedrova), the Widow Irene Papas) and the crazy / silly city (Sotiris Moustakas). In addition to all these characters, add the inhabitants of the village of Crete (where most of the history goes), which oscillate between a great chorus of representation of the local inhabitants and at other moments, this mass of the population obtains the prowess of being the Protagonists of "Zorba", influencing in the plots and determining situations. Perhaps the weakest point of the script, in the non-relationship in particular, with the women's history of the film, the widow and Madame, both seem to be a resource to symbolize, a specific love relationship in the life of the two friends, but Are only one in front of the others that have already come and the others that will still come, by the way, the film provides few clues about the past and even fewer about the future of the characters Zorba and Basil, which is not a bad thing, if there is something That neo-realism clearly points out, is the coming and going of stories that cross us. A special highlight for the photography of Walter Lassally and the art direction of Vassilis Photopoulos, both deservedly awarded the Oscars in their respective categories and which are striking to this day, a true composition class and artistic feature, the reflection of this is remarkable also Quality of the movie. One aside that is necessary here, is for the quality in the work of all the actors, indisputably excellent, with special attention to the female performance and in great prominence, Anthony Quinn, an undoubtedly enviable actor. When we know a little about the story of this Mexican actor, who was boxing fighter ... finally, when we know a little more about his life and career, our chin falls and we are even more admired for his work. Quinn, performed in "Zorba" a rare feat for many other actors, composing a timeless character, which until today is referenced and revered. Without doubt, a brilliant work by an equally brilliant actor.

Review: I had been wanting to watch this film forever and finally got around to it, and I really enjoyed it. Anthony Quinn is outstanding in the film, he owns the screen every second he's on it. I also like Alan bates in it. The cinematography deservedly won an Oscar. The film has lots of humour, but it also very dark at times. I found watching it to be a rewarding experience.
