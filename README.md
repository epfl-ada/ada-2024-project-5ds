# ADA 2024 - Team 5DS -- "Predicting success through the winning formula: What makes a movie gain an award ?"

### Abstract:

In this project, we’re diving into what makes a movie stand out enough to win an award. By analyzing a dataset of movies, we aim to uncover trends across factors such as genre, theme, and actor characteristics, questioning if there exists a “winning formula” for cinematic recognition. This choice is mostly mostivated because award recognition not only boosts a film’s prestige but can also propel careers and influence industry standards, from actors to screenwriters with a deep mark on our society nowadays.

Our approach looks at how both actors and films benefit from awards, and how different awards might value different qualities. By exploring these patterns, we aim to understand the main elements that make a movie award-worthy. This could give helpful insights to both filmmakers and audiences about how genre, themes, and cast play a role in making a movie stand out to award panels.


### Subquestions we want to answer:

In this analysis there are several reasearch subquestions we want to answer : 
- Is there a correlation between the actor's phenotype and/or their TV tropes and the award they received? 
- Does a past award win increase an actor's odds of winning again? 
- Is there a correlation between the movie's phenotype and/or box-office sales and/or plots and the award it won?
- How does public reviews translate a movie's prestige, whether it be critic or amateur? 
- How do regional preferences in film awards influence the diversity of films that gain global recognition?
- How does the timing of award recognition (before vs. after a film’s release) reflect changes in industry perceptions and audience reception?

### Used Dataset

We will use the CMU Summary Corpus, updated to 2024, which includes movies from 2016 to 2024 sourced from Wikipedia. Our focus will be on identifying award-winning films from this period and before, specifically those recognized by the Oscars, Cesars, and Palmes d'Or. In addition, we will gather data on actors and movie sets associated with these three prestigious awards, in order to have an exhaustive view on the factors that contribute to a movie’s or actor’s likelihood of winning. To enrich our dataset, we will also scrape critics' and audience reviews from Rotten Tomatoes. We believe that this comprehensive dataset will provide enough information to address the questions we aim to explore in our analysis.
